            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN we ſee any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Effect, 'tis uſual for us to enquire the Cauſe; whether it be in things Natural, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, or Moral. Every new Appearance in the Heavens invites us to conſider its Reaſon. Any uſeful Engine framed by exquiſite Art, tempts the Curious to examine its inward Springs and Movements. And when we obſerve a Perſon to manage his Province or Affairs ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, we are willing to know the Rules and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by which he guides himſelf. There is the like Tendency in the renewed Soul, when it ſees any one of extraordinary Elevation in Religion and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to conſider the inward Principles that act them.</p>
            <p>The A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THOR was obſerved to be a Perſon of great Wiſdom, and ſingular Holineſs; equally admired and loved by thoſe who knew him. And ſome who had the happineſs to be intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and have heard with what Clearneſs and inward Senſe he would diſcourſe of
<pb facs="tcp:109216:3"/> the ſublimeſt things in Religion, have been ready to ſay what was once ſaid of Chriſt; <hi>Whence hath this Man this Learning?</hi> Whence did he derive his Knowledge and Holineſs? But the following DISCO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RSES lay open unto us the inward Springs of them both. It hath been obſerved that there is nothing more influential upon the Divine Life than a conſtant and deep Impreſſion of our own Corruption and Impotence, together with a continual Dependance upon the Redeemer's Grace: both which were in an eminent degree viſible in him. There is throughout the whole of his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi> an admirable Depreſſion of Sin and Self, with an Exaltation of Chriſt and Divine Grace, and a believing Admiration of his Perſon; with a continual living upon him in the Exerciſes of Faith and Love.</p>
            <p>And indeed, there is no true Spring of Holineſs but Faith in the Mediator, the <hi>Purchaſer</hi> of all Grace; and the Spirit, the <hi>Conveyer</hi> of it; from which ſome having turned away, have made <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi> both of Faith, Holineſs, and even of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertue too. There hath not been, there cannot be any ſteady and firm Principle of Holineſs, but Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; the abundant Efficacy of which upon the Divine Life, the A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THOR was a very ſenſible and full Inſtance of.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing in the following DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RSES which may recede from <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Accuracy,</hi> you muſt know that he was but a private Perſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:109216:3"/>
            <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> of his <hi>Phraſe</hi> is ſomewhat peculiar, yet ſuch as he found moſt proper to expreſs his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sentiments, and whereas he could (as he ſaid to a Friend) have altered and refined the Phraſe, yet he did rather let it alone, writing it only for his own private uſe; judging too, that as he had his in Meditations a very ſpecial Aſſiſtance from the Spirit of God, ſo the words which cloathed them were moſt genuine, natural, and agreeable to his purpoſe. And indeed, there is ſuch a lively and ſenſible Affection in his Style, that nothing elſe but an intimate feeling and experience of the things themſelves could ſuggeſt; which doth at the ſame time equally inſtruct and move.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Diſcourſe of finding God a Sanctuary,</hi> he doth in a very expreſs manner <hi>enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God;</hi> which may both encourage and direct in the performance of it. Some holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in their practical Diſcourſes have adviſed to this, but there are few who have put it in practice: nay, many have alledged this as the reaſon of their <hi>backwardneſs</hi> to it, the ſenſe that they had of their inability to perform it; and the making it in ſo ſolemn a manner, and then tranſgreſſing the ſame, it might but involve them in the greater difficulties of Mind. But the A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THOR doth it in that way and manner, as to take off the force of this Objection, which doth much ariſe from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the nature of the Goſpel-Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God calls us to nothing but what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:109216:4"/> his Grace ſhall enable us to perform. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf unto it in a very great ſenſe of his own weakneſs, and the Riches of Divine Grace; relying on that to enable him to perform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on his part. By which means his entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant was ſo far from being a <hi>Snare</hi> to him (of which he was very cautious) as that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a mighty <hi>Support</hi> to his Faith and Aſſurance. So that his Sins and Infirmities (which were more diſcernable to himſelf than others) did not make him (as he ſaid) to queſtion his Intereſt in the Covenant; he found that an undue way of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: but did excite him by a freſh Application of the Blood of Sprinkling, according to the Tenure of that new Covenant, to ſeek out both their Pardon, and Mortification; there being a Proviſion of Righteouſneſs and Strength in it, through him who is the Mediator and Head of it.</p>
            <p>His LETTERS are but a very few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe multitudes that he wrote of the like nature and import, more of which could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. And for Brevity ſake, the Preface and Cloſe are ſometimes omitted, with what related to Civil Affairs. He had a moſt earneſt deſire to do good: So that what was ſaid of <hi>Timothy</hi> may be well applied to him, <hi>That he did naturally care for the Good of Men.</hi> And therefore he would both by his Exhortations when preſent, and his Letters when abſent, endeavour to promote the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Welfare of thoſe who were bleſt with his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:109216:4"/>
            <p>As to his laſt and DYING SPEECHES and PRAYERS, they were taken from him without his Obſervation, by thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with him, and were greatly affected <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:</hi> In which there may be ſome things a little abrupt, by reaſon of his great weakneſs and pains diverting him. But they have in them that deep ſavour of Religion, and expreſs ſo powerful a ſenſe of Divine Grace, as 'tis thought they would not be unacceptable to ſerious Perſons.</p>
            <p>To conclude, What is here expoſed to view was without the A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THOR's deſign, and at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Relations and Friends; who being greatly affected therewith, judged it might leave ſome good Impreſſions on thoſe who read it: wherein we have an uſeful <hi>Syſteme</hi> of practical Divinity, written with an inward Senſe and Experience, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vigorous and lively actings of Grace, and giving us a clear and diſtinct <hi>Anatomy</hi> of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit. How ſublimely doth he ſoar in his Contemplations; viewing Chriſt both in his Perſon and Office, with his Ordination to, Fitneſs for, and Diſcharge of it? Whence his Faith is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ſtrengthned, accompanied with a ſenſe of his Guilt and Impotence, which every where he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, frequently bewailing the Corruption of Nature.</p>
            <p>How doth that Faith exert it ſelf in great love to, deſires after, and delight in Chriſt; with an exact and univerſal Obedience to his commanding Will, and a meek and patient Reſignation to his afflicting Will.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:109216:5"/>
            <p>The whole of which very clearly manifeſts his moſt ſerious and earneſt Concernment about eternal things, and ſerves to diſprove thoſe who believe that Religion is nothing elſe but a grand piece of Hypocriſie. Such Inſtances tend to check the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infidelity and Atheiſm of the preſent Age, wherein Religion is thought to be but an Artifice of State, the Policy of Princes; entertained only by the many, and rejected by the more Intelligent.</p>
            <p>It ſerves alſo to awaken thoſe that are ſincere, to a more vigorous Exerciſe of Grace: What one hath attained to, others may; the ſame Principles of Holineſs lie open to all.</p>
            <p>And that what is ſaid may be more convincing, a CHARACTER of the A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>THOR is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned (wherein the efficacy of his <hi>Meditations</hi> is moſt ſenſibly exemplified) drawn up in the Straits of time by a private hand, who was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him throughout his Life; and if in it there be any thing defective, 'tis not to be imputed to him whoſe CHARACTER it is, but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nskilfulneſs of the Hand that did attempt to draw it; who hath compoſed it without the Methods of Art, or curious Ornaments of Phraſe: But ſuited it to the plainneſs of the A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOR, expreſſed both in his Life, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Compoſures.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ley,</hi> in the County of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter;</hi> and was the fifth Child, and Son of Mr. <hi>Thomas Dorney,</hi> Gent. and <hi>Joanna</hi> his Wife; both very religious; and had a numerous Iſſue (in all, eleven Children:) towards whom they had a moſt tender and Parental Care, and were induſtriouſly diligent in bringing them up <hi>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi> Their eldeſt Son was bred a Scholar at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and placed at the <hi>Inns of Court;</hi> and after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Barriſter, continued in the Practice of the Law until he died. Their ſecond and third Sons deceaſed in their Infancy and Minority. Their fourth Son alſo was bred a Scholar, and

But it is the fifth Son, Mr. <hi>Henry Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> who is the Subject of this following CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACTER.</p>
            <p>After he had been Religiouſly educated by his Parents, and furthered in Learning at Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Schools, he was about the fourteenth Year of his Age, brought up to <hi>London;</hi> where he ſpent much of his time with them, in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the publick Ordinances of God's Word and Worſhip, at the Morning and Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lectures, beſide the Solemnities of Worſhip on the Lord's Day. At which time (as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) began the work of God's Grace effectually to ſeize on his heart. And after a ſhort Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in <hi>London,</hi> he retired again into the Country, in the Purſuance of <hi>Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and was at length ſetled at <hi>Newbury Free-School;</hi> where in a Years time, or little more, he thrived ſo ſwift in Learning, that he became compleatly fit for the Univerſity: But for ſome Cogent Reaſons, his Father (with his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he being always very obſequious) thought it more convenient to diſpoſe of him to a Trade: In Attendance on which, and all along in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109216:6"/> variety of outward Changes in the Courſe of his Life, and amidſt his buſieſt Secular Affairs and Employments, he yet kept the Rudiments of his School-Learning: applying himſelf with great diligence, as he had ſpare time, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Studies in the Original Tongues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was very expert and accurate; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Hebrew; and retained an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them to his dying day.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to his Natural<note place="margin">His Natural Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> Abilities, he had a quick Fancy and Invention, a ripe Wit, a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious Memory, a large Underſtanding, and a profound Judgment.</p>
            <p>His natural Temper was Grave,<note place="margin">His Natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> Amiable, Affable: he had Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs mixt with Gravity, and Chearfulneſs mixt with Seriouſneſs; much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning an affected Melancholy and Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs. He had an undaunted Courage, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Meekneſs; and ſeldom, if ever, ſeen diſcompoſed with Paſſion of any ſort. He was plain-hearted, kind, ſociable; not at all Loquacious, or given to much Talk; yet not ſparing to ſpeak when and where he ſaw it needful, and had a Call thereto. He affected not Moroſeneſs on the one hand, nor was he complemental on the other; yet courteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, and uſed Flattery to none, either in Speech or Action.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109216:7"/>
            <p>When he approached to God<note place="margin">His Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> in Duty, it ſeemed to be with a great Awe upon his Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his Mind from every thing that might diſtract him; eſpecially in Prayer: endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to do what he did as in God's ſight, with ſpiritual Vigour and Activity; according to his own Saying, that <hi>We muſt not be Drones in God's Work, but be rouzed and enlivened in all the Services we perform to him; which alſo ſhould be chiefly inward, with as little outward appearance as may be.</hi> He was one devoted to Prayer; which took up a great part of his ſpare time, both in the Day, and in the Night, when he was awake, and not hindred by Weakneſs, and other Bodily Diſtempers. And he was wont to ſay to this effect, when he diſcerned not the like readineſs in others, who were more addicted to Conference; <hi>We, alas (at leaſt, ſome of us) know a great deal notionally, but its Prayer in the Spirit is the Work we ſhould chiefly mind.</hi> And when he had been deſired to declare his Opinion of any difficult Scripture (wherein he had a deep Inſight) he ſpake to this purpoſe; <hi>If you would know the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch or ſuch a Scripture, pray over it; that being the moſt effectual Means to come to know the Mind of God's Spirit in his Word.</hi> And he had ſuch a holy Intimacy and Familiarity with God, that he would ſpeak to him in Prayer, as if one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109216:7"/> Cordial Friend were ſpeaking to another; yet with great Humiliation, Proſtration and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And when the Frame of his Soul was never ſo little out of order, he ſeemed to be very much troubled, until he could get into ſome place of Retirement, for the re-gaining of his former delightful Frame of Communion with God. And this he would be often ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, to his moſt inward Friends. And his manner was, when he prayed alone, not to uſe his Voice at all; but all his ſtriving in Prayer was inward; ſaying, that <hi>Bodily Exerciſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited little;</hi> and more eſpecially in ſecret Prayer. And alſo, when he joyned with others in Prayer, he ſeldom was ſeen or heard to ſtir; as accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it would be matter of diſturbance. And he would be ſure, as to his own particular, to uſe no higher Voice in Prayer than was meerly neceſſary for thoſe that were preſent, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him in the ſame Duty: often ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſlike of ſuch a raiſed Voice in Prayer, as might be diſtinctly heard any further than that Room or place where thoſe that joyned in Prayer were aſſembled. Alſo, except the Caſe was extraordinary, he did not approve of making long Prayers, but rather more frequent; eſpecially in and with a Family; leſt ſome other neceſſary Duties might be omitted, or the time that ought to be ſpent about them abridged: and more particularly at Nights, that Family-Duties
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109216:8"/> ſhould be more conciſe; leſt through wearineſs, Servants and others ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with Sleep. And he ſaid, that <hi>The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many make long Prayers and multiplied words, was, that they doubted God did not hear them, and therefore they would pray the more, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by much ſpeaking, ſomething might take with God.</hi> And he further ſaid, that <hi>As Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices of old were not regarded any further than they typified Chriſt, ſo God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in the outward Carnal Performance of Religious Duties, nor in any thing performed only by the Abilities of the Outward Man:</hi> And that Prayer ſhould be the holding of the Promiſe in the one hand, and the Petition in the other. That our words ſhould be few, with a ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Compoſure of Mind and Spirit in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that <hi>We often come before the Lord, furniſhed with words, when the power of Faith, and of the Spirit is wanting. And that we never pray with delight, until we believe that our Prayers are heard, and will be anſwered; which we put up to God in the Name of Chriſt, according to his Will.</hi> And that without a perſonal Intereſt in Chriſt, there is no Approach unto God. If our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be not in him, it would be in vain to ſeek him; for we could never come at him, were not our perſons united to him. And as to his own experience, he ſaid, <hi>Sometimes I find I am exceeding heartleſs in Duty; that I go unto it as</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:109216:8"/> 
               <hi>one altogether dead; yet being convinced it is my duty, I ſpeak the words in Prayer: and doubtleſs, ſuch words, where there is a ſtriving of the Spirit againſt the Fleſh to overcome that Indiſpoſedneſs, they are prevalent with God, though we may not account them ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was ſo often and frequent, <note place="margin">His ſecret Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> both Day and Night, in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, that his Life was no other but a conſtant Walking with him.</p>
            <p>In his Family he ſo wiſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved<note place="margin">His Family-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> himſelf in his Diſcipline, and by his grave, ſweet, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Carriage, that all under his Roof did both reverence and love him: And his endeavour and care was (if it were poſſible) to receive and retain none in his Houſe but ſuch as truly feared God. And if it happened at any time, that any Servants proved bad, he would turn them off ſo ſoon as he could; but yet always at their parting, by his Prayers for them, his Counſel, Advice and Liberality to them, none ſuch went from him, but at their departure, did, or might have carried with them a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemning Conviction of his Goodneſs, and their own Folly. He alſo uſed to Catechiſe his Servants on certain days of the Week, ſo far as other important Affairs, and his natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Body would permit.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:109216:9"/>
            <p>His daily Family-Duties were<note place="margin">His Family-Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> in this method performed. Firſt he prayed before the reading of God's Word; which was obſerved to be to this effect: <hi>That God would favour us with his Preſence in our Approaches to him, and make us ſenſible we have to do with him, who is the living God; and with his Word, as a living Word. That it might not be as a dry Well, as a dead Letter, nor our hearts dead in the peruſal of it; but that it might come as Water on a thirsty Ground, and we made fat with the fatneſs of it, our Souls being capacitated to ſuck in its ſweetneſs; that we might have ſome ſweet ſenſe of his Holineſs, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him; and that put forwards in the uſe of the Word and Prayer. That God would cloath his Word with Almightineſs; cauſing his Arm to be unbared, and his Truths to be revealed, that they might be a bright Lamp to our Feet, and a Light to our Paths. That all his Divine Dictates be taken in with all greedineſs; that thence Vertue might flow out, and enter into our hearts, and be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Operation of God upon our Souls, and his Power unto our Salvation. That God would conſult his own Grace, that we might have his Preſence, both in the Word, and in our hearts, in an efficacious way; cauſing it kindly to operate. That ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Grace might drop down unto us; and that the Word being every whit of it ſpiritual, might ſpiritualize our hearts, and influence them to an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109216:9"/> Obediential Compliance with his whole Will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in revealed. That he would cauſe it to take hold of our hearts, that they might be bowed down, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and healed by its powerful vertue and efficacy; making us to delight therein, and that through Chriſt we might be a delight unto himſelf. That God would quicken and enlighten us, and cauſe his Word to come with Power and Life. That we might behold his Glory and Majeſty, ſhining in every part of his Word. And as God had put an Almightineſs in it, ſo he would command the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Authority of it, to bear in with an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight upon our hearts; and make it Almighty in all its efficacious Actings. And that the Vital Power of his Spirit might cleanſe, lead, and teach us in the way everlaſting. And that the Word might be as an Inſtrument and Means in the hand of his Spirit, to do all this for us, and in us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in the reading of the Word, he would uſually ſpend a little time, in ſpeaking to the moſt remarkable Heads therein contained; improving it for the Inſtruction and Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf and Family. And after that, he cloſed the Morning Exerciſe with ſolemn Prayer. And his Evening Exerciſe was firſt, Prayer for a Bleſſing on the Word to be read; after which he read a Chapter, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with Prayer.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:109216:10"/>
            <p>For the right underſtanding<note place="margin">His Directions for underſtanding the Word, and profiting by it.</note> of Scripture-Truths, his Counſel was, that we ſhould compare ſpiritual things with ſpiritual; which is diſcerningly to ſuit the way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Utterance, in ſuch a ſpiritual Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as may beſt agree with the nature of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Myſtery of the Goſpel; and not to ſpeak ſpiritual things carnally, in the Wiſdom of the Fleſh. And that we can never profit by the Word heard or read, until we receive it, and take it up, as a Meſſage from the Lord to our Souls; as the Word of the over-living God: ſaying, <hi>I would ſo read the Scriptures, or other good Books, that in reading, I would drink in the matter or things therein preſented; and have my heart to feed thereon all the while.</hi> And that we ſhould judge of every part of holy Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of Faith, and body of Truth. And more particularly touching the THREATNINGS we meet with in Scripture, we muſt note they are always to be underſtood, with a ſecret implied Condition; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if we return to God, they ſhall not be inflicted on us: But when God ſwears to his Threatnings, there he makes it good; as in the Caſe of the unbelieving <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And for <hi>Scripture</hi>-PROMISES; we muſt not look on any Promiſe, but in and through Chriſt; in whom alone they are <hi>Yea and Amen. And that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109216:10"/> we ſhould labour after the believing ſight of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is more worth than all the Gold and Silver in the World:</hi> And therefore we ſhould catch at the Promiſes (having a Right to them in Chriſt) as a Man ſwimming lays hold on a thing, when he ſees himſelf in danger; and bear our ſelves nakedly on them, as a Swimmer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Bladders. And for this, get a through Belief that there is but one God; that this God is the ſame, his Covenant the ſame, and ever the ſame; that his words are the ſame as ever they were in <hi>Noah, Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi>'s time; putting our ſelves in their Caſe: As, put caſe I were <hi>Noah, Abraham, Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> And we muſt come up to this Perſuaſion, that God ever abideth faithful, and that the Kernel of the Promiſe, both then and now, is God's Will in Chriſt. And touching the COMMANDS <hi>of the Word,</hi> we muſt note, That <hi>'tis heavy work to eye God's Command only in our Obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking to him for ſtrength; for to us under the Goſpel, God never intended the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any otherwiſe than as a Rule, not as our Strength, for Power belongeth unto God; he gives Power and Strength to fulfil his own Commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a ſtrict Obſerver of<note place="margin">His Obſervation of the Sabbath.</note> the Lord's Day; and could not endure either to ſpeak himſelf, or hear ſpoken by others, any thing that tended to withdraw the heart from the Sanctification
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109216:11"/> of that ſacred Seaſon; and would allow of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to be then ſaid or done, but what was of Mercy, and meer neceſſity; according to that word in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. and <hi>Lev. 19. 30. Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary;</hi> beſide the expreſs Injunction in the fourth Commandment. He exceedingly <hi>loved the Habitation of God's Houſe, and the place where his Honour dwelleth.</hi> He valued the Goſpel-Miniſtry at a mighty rate. He eſteemed not of Men for Learning and Parts, where he ſaw the Grace of God wanting; and that they preached themſelves, and not Jeſus Chriſt: but where both concurred, he had always the greateſt Reverence and Veneration for them. And to prepare himſelf and Family for the due Celebration of the Sabbath, and for the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of that day, he was heard to offer up in Prayer ſuch Petitions as theſe; <hi>That God would draw nigh to us in the powerful Working and Operation of his Grace, and cauſe the Dew of Heaven to fall upon us, that our Fleece might not be dry, that our Witheredneſs might paſs from us. That we might have a Verdure, a Greenneſs on our Spirits, and be anointed as with freſh Oyl. That as he hath preſented us to another Sabbath, ſo he would make it a good day to us; giving us throughout the day, that Thirſting and Hungering to which the Promiſe is intitled: and cauſe his Omnipotent Arm to bring Salvation, and eſtabliſh it in our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109216:11"/> hearts; granting us the Light of Life, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us ſo to hear, that our Souls might live, be made fat with the Fatneſs of his Houſe, and be made to drink of the River of his Pleaſures. That no Guilt might abide on us, but be taken wholly away, and our Souls freed from the Captivity of a Fleſhly Mind and Will. That he would cut thoſe Fetters aſunder, and work ſome Renewing upon our hearts, ſome ſpiritual Strength, Warmth and Refreſhing. That we might have a free Intercourſe with him throughout the day; praying in Prayer, and hear in Hearing, and ſee the Face of God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and they made powerful and transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That Jeſus Chriſt might come in his Kingly Power, in the Miniſtry of his Word, and deſtroy all the Bonds of the Prince of Darkneſs. That he would not ſuffer the evil Angels to diſquiet and diſturb his People in their waiting on him; but that they might attend upon the Lord without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction. That in what we do, we might honour him who is the Lord of the Sabbath. That he in Jeſus Chriſt might be well pleaſed with us, and ſee and behold his own Working in us, and upon us; and ſay,</hi> It is very good. <hi>Taht he would grant us a ſolid Conſideration of things ſpiritual, and a higher proſpect thereof, ſo as to affect our hearts; and that our Scope and Aym in all things might be to pleaſe him, and profit our own Souls. That he would grant us his Preſence and Teaching, and the Operations of his Spirit, in the uſe of his Word,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109216:12"/> which is ſpiritual: and that our time and life be ſpent in his fear. That our Hopes be upward, our Conſiderations inward, and our Converſe with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, as thoſe that are above in the Mount with God,</hi> &amp;c. And his manner was, in the Evening of the Sabbath, after the publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity was over, to repeat himſelf, or by ſome other in his Family, both the Sermons preached on that day; with Prayer both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the ſame, accompanied with the ſinging of a Pſalm; after which, he ſupped: and then concluding the day, again with ſolemn Prayer, he retired himſelf to his private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo went to Reſt.</p>
            <p>He had a great Inſight into the<note place="margin">His Inſight into Spiritual and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things.</note> Myſtery of the Goſpel, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things: And this is evident in the ſeveral following Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in his Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in ſuch Expreſſions as theſe; <hi>That there is a Tang and Touch of the Goſpel, which only the Called of God knows. And that none can know Chriſt ſavingly, but thoſe that are united unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CONCERNING GOD'S UNCHANGEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLENESS: That though Man be Changeable, yet God ſtands to his Purpoſe and Promiſe; appearing Righteous in his Works, either in conquering a Sinner by his Juſtice, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and removing of his Sin, through Grace by Faith; and ſo ſaving the Sinner; ordering
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109216:12"/> the very Sin of the Elect to exalt his Mercy. Though Sin is not in its own nature, but by Accident, the cauſe of glorifying God's Grace. And ſo moſt juſtly he puniſheth the ſinful World for their own Sins, and the Sins of the Elect in their Mediator.</p>
            <p>OF GOD'S LOVE AND TENDERNESS to his People: That God never comes into any Soul, but he leaves a Bleſſing behind him; he pays well for his Entertainment before he parts. <hi>And more particularly;</hi> That if a poor Child ſhould come to his Father, and ſay, Father, I would not offend you; it goes to my very heart, when-ever I do offend and grieve you: Teach me therefore (O my Father) ſo as that I may not offend you in what I do. Will not hereupon an indulgent Father compaſſionate ſuch a Child? And hath not God much more pity towards his Children, who is the Fountain of Love and Tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the</hi> DIS-RELISH <hi>of</hi> SPIRITUAL THINGS <hi>to a</hi> GRACELESS HEART: That the things of God, and of Soul-Concern are but a dry Morſel to a Carnal heart; that ſuch an one may talk of Heaven, of the Glory and Happineſs thereof, and may ſeem to be ſomewhat taken therewith: but if a good Bargain, or ſome Worldly Profit inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the heart of ſuch an one is preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and tickled with another kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:109216:13"/>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Of the vaſt difference betwixt a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and one that is not ſo:</hi> That a Chriſtian indeed is a ſtrange thing, one that outwardly appears to live in the World like others: yet there is ſomething within him unſeen, that is as different from what is in others, as Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>CONCERNING TRUE FAITH: That it is the giving up of our Souls to God in an Act of Reliance on him for himſelf, and thoſe things we deſire of him according to his Will: that Aſſurance is rather the Flower or Seal of Faith, than Faith properly. That Chriſtians are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much miſtaken about Faith, in taking it for a ſure Confidence and Belief that God will help and deliver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Faith chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Recumbency and Reliance on God, a leaning, a rolling upon him to help us, or for whatſoever Mercy we deſire of him; and not that he will help or deliver, out of ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular trouble, or to beſtow on us ſuch or ſuch a thing we want, or remove ſuch an Evil we fear; that being rather the Product, Effect and Privilege of Faith. Many complain they have not Faith, when they have no Aſſurance of God's Performance, though they are all the while in the Exerciſe of Believing: and that Faith is the Faith that juſtifies; and true Faith is ſuch as realizeth things abſent, remote and future. That it is not the nearneſs of a thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109216:13"/> makes it real; but Faith ſeeth a thing to be real, though afar off; when we are apt to judge many times of the reality of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are near. Alſo true Faith dwells in a pure Conſcience, it makes its Neſt there, it purifies the heart.</p>
            <p>His Faith in God's Covenant<note place="margin">His Faith in God's Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</note> and Promiſe, inſtead of many other Inſtances, appeared in theſe ſhort Sayings: That thoſe who cannot live nakedly upon a Promiſe, in the want of a thing, will not know how to uſe it as they ſhould when they have it: and if I were ſure to live but one Hour, this ſhould be my Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, The Acting of my Faith upon God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: and whilſt the Soul is thus in an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous Frame, this is not Preſumption, neither cannot be. It alſo exerted it ſelf in Prayer in ſuch Expreſſions as theſe. <hi>That the Lord would arm us by his Fear, even with that Fear that is the Concomitant of Love, and let them both be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us; for it is one Clauſe of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that he will put his Fear into our hearts, that we may fear him and his Goodneſs, and that his Name be great in our Eye, that may preſerve us from departing from him. That the Covenant of his Grace might be a Tree of ripe Fruit to us, and that the Hand of Grace might ſhake it; that the Fruit may fall down, and we may gather it up for our daily Refreſhment.</hi>

            <p>His Love to God and Chriſt was ſeen in the Courſe of his<note place="margin">His Love to God and Chriſt.</note> Obedience to Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and his great Submiſſion to all afflictive Diſpenſations from God: Alſo in his great Love to the People of God; in his frequent, ſecret, and cloſe Communion with God here, and a longing deſire to be tranſlated by Death, into his immediate Preſence and Fruition.</p>
            <p>His Aſſurance of God's Love:<note place="margin">His Aſſurance of the Love of God.</note> His <hi>Practical Diſcourſes, Letters, the ſolemn Covenant he entred into with God,</hi> and his <hi>Dying Speeches,</hi> do through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out plainly demonſtrate.

And now, O God of all Grace and Glory, let this Covenant that thou haſt cauſed, and drawn me to renew with thee, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Heaven, and in the heart of thy poor Servant; and caſting my ſelf upon thee, I claim thee to be my God; and I give my ſelf to thee: and this Evening, an Evening greatly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; the 28th. of</hi> January, 1663. <hi>I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe irrevocably hereunto, with my Hand;</hi>

            <p>Moreover, in a former Sickneſs, and under Bodily Ailments, being asked whether there were any thing burthenſome upon his Spirit; he replied, <hi>I have no diſtruſt in him whom I have believed.

            </p>
            <p>His Deſires after Glory were<note place="margin">His Deſires after Glory.</note> in a peculiar manner exerted in his laſt and <hi>Dying Speeches and Prayers;</hi> and at other times before, in many and various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and chiefly upon this Ground, that he ſhould then be perfectly freed from Sin, and ſerve God without diſtraction. And it may be uſeful here to mention this following Paſſage, that a dear Friend once making his moan to him, about vain impertinent Thoughts,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109216:16"/> wherewith he was greatly haunted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Attendance on God in Duty: He ſaid to him no more than this, <hi>That that very thing ſhould make us willing to be gone hence to be with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had an entire Reſpect to<note place="margin">His univerſal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> all God's Commands; avoiding all Appearance of Evil, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of all Opportunities for receiving and doing good; and his very Soul was in it: and it ſeemed as natural to him, as for a perſon to eat when he is hungry: Yea, he was as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of his Element, moſt uneaſie and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whilſt he was not actually ſo exerciſed. And his Submiſſion to the Will of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as always, ſo it was remarkably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in his laſt Sickneſs, and alſo in a former Sickneſs; when he was heard to ſay, <hi>Lord, if it may pleaſe thee, make my Paſſage eaſie. If thou wilt have me go</hi> (meaning his departure by Death) <hi>I am willing: If thou wilt have me to ſtay a little longer, I am willing: but, Oh! for Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Divine Aid.</hi> Likewiſe it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in theſe Petitions he offered up to God in Prayer; <hi>That the Lord would manage every one of our Thoughts, and ſpiritualize them for his whole Will; and that his Spirit may have the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our hearts: And ſeeing it is the property of his People, ſo far as they are ſpiritualized, to love and delight in all his Statutes, and to love his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Will and Word, as well as his promiſing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109216:16"/> Word. That he would lead us into the Light and Life of Jeſus Chriſt, and cauſe us to yield up our ſelves univerſally to his Rule and Government, and greedily take in all that Grace and Kindneſs he hath offered to us, and get up into the Region of Chriſt's Teaching and Leading. That we might be formed to his liking, and as a People whom he delighteth to own and love; and be fitted for the whole Will of God, that he would have us to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Mortification was clearly<note place="margin">His Mortification.</note> evinced, by his Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which ſhould be always the Objective Matter, for that Grace to be exerciſed upon; and by theſe directions he propoſed, as Means and Perſuaſives to it; That we ſhould always ſeek an occaſion againſt the Fleſh; as 'tis ſaid of the King of <hi>Syria, He ſeeketh a Quarrel againſt me:</hi> and when we cannot pray it down, or meditate it down, then apply our ſelves to good Company, and holy Conference with others; and be ever engaged one way or other, with one Weapon or other againſt the Fleſh; <hi>as</hi> Sampſon <hi>againſt the</hi> Philiſtines, <hi>who ſought an occaſion againſt them.</hi> And that the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Temporal Mercy is to be dead to it: And that as they that will be rich fall into Temptation and a Snare, the like it may be ſaid of thoſe that will not be poor. And he further added, that we muſt be mortified as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109216:17"/> well to Saints as Sinners, if we will have true Peace. And that if all things were in a right frame, the Soul would be dead to all carnal and earthly things, and be ever under full Sail for Heaven: and how then would the Breath of Grace appear in all the Actions of our Lives. And for the promoting of this neceſſary Work, he was obſerved earneſtly to pray, <hi>That morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying renewing Grace might always appear active in us, and that there might be a ſecret delight in us, to take Vengeance of all that carnal Frame and corrupt Inclination that is within us, and an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger deſire to have this Body of Death crucified and taken away. That a Sentence of Death might paſs upon this Body of Sin and Death in us, which Chriſt died to remove. That this Body of Death might be battered down and waſted day by day. And that he would cauſe us always to have a War againſt the Law of Sin within us. And that we might long to have it ſubdued, and the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God's Grace advanced in our Souls. And that our Affections and Deſires might decay more and more towards all things that are of a fading, periſhing Nature. And that he would crucifie and deſtroy in us all the Attempts of the Body of Sin, wherewith we are continually haunted. And that he would help us to quit our ſelves as thoſe that are engaged to God, and favoured by him; and know what it is to have our Natures changed, and the natural Enmity ſlain. And that we might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109216:17"/> into Jeſus Christ, and made one with him. That the things above might be the great things in our eye, and have more Room in our hearts; and the things here below accounted little, and be of low Eſteem with us.</hi>

            <p>The conſtant ſeriouſneſs of his<note place="margin">His conſtant Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</note> Spirit was ſeen, not only in his Carriage, but in his Cautions to others about it; ſaying, that there are many thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors periſh eternally for want of Seriouſneſs, and that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> herein was a great Preſident for our Imitation. And in company of ſome Friends he ſpake to this purpoſe; <hi>We, even ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we muſt appear before the Judge of Heaven and Earth, that judgeth the Quick and the Dead: and the Enquiry will not be then, How rich, or how poor we have been? But how did we thrive in the ways of Holineſs? What Work of Faith, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Love, Patience of Hope? What Exerciſe of Grace? What Zeal for God? How did we make the Glory of God ſhine forth in our Lives? Therefore let our main Care be, that we do not miſs of Heaven at laſt; for 'tis poſſible, after a glorious Profeſſion, the Soul may miſcarry for all that. And I do not ſpeak this to put a damp upon you; but to quicken and caution you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Zeal againſt all Sin was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent<note place="margin">His Zeal againſt Sin.</note> in his general Courſe. He ſhunned all Appearances of Evil; hating even the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh: Whence he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109216:18"/> gave this Counſel; <hi>Go not within the Clutches of a Temptation, to ſee what it is, before you reſiſt: 'tis eaſier to paſs by a Temptation, than to come out of it: When the Knot is knit, and the Door bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 'tis harder to get Freedom than before.</hi> And alſo he was obſerved to ſay, <hi>That the leaſt Evil admitted, hath a Tendency in it, toward the utmoſt Link of Distance from God: and the leaſt Sin indulged, is like unto a Cockatrice indulged, which turns into a Fiery Flying Serpent,</hi> Iſa. 14. 29.</p>
            <p>His Zeal and Activity for God<note place="margin">His Zeal and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for God.</note> throughout his Chriſtian Race did eminently ſhew it ſelf, by improving all opportunities to advance his Glory in doing good to Souls, eſpecially amongſt his Relations and intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; where the Lord was pleaſed greatly to ſucceed his faithful and ſincere Endeavours: and the more in that there was ſuch a Grateful Majeſty in his Carriage, and in thoſe patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expreſſions uttered by him. That it may be truly ſaid of him (in his private Capacity) <hi>That his Lips fed many, and his Mouth was a Well of Life.</hi> And he uſed to pray for his Relations in ſuch words as theſe; <hi>That the Lord would deal with Relations in a way of ſaving powerful Conviction, and ſpiritual Operation. And that ſuch in whom is the Seed of God ſown, might grow up to be Plants of Righteouſneſs, in whom he might be glorified; and have the Seal of his Grace and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109216:18"/> Favour put upon them, and be numbred amongſt thoſe that are cared for by the Lord, and houſed in him.</hi> And for ſuch Relations as were at a diſtance from him, he alſo frequently viſited with Letters, and would be ſometimes ſending them Books; uſing variety of Means for their ſpiritual Welfare. Likewiſe he would be wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in Verſe: and inſtead of many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it may not be improper to inſert theſe two of plain Verſe, which accompanied two Bibles he tranſmitted, <hi>viz.</hi>

And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Courage before the Rulers and Elders of the Jews, did evidence that they had been with Jeſus. And (as hath been already ſuggeſted) he had ſuch a holy Intimacy with God, that he would ſpeak to him in Prayer, as if one Friend were ſpeaking to another; yet with great Reverence, Humility, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abaſement. And he would be frequently ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it upon his Friends, that they ſhould not reſt, till they had attained a more inward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God. And that we ſhould labour after a greater Intimacy with God, than with any Perſon in the World; and when we are alone, we ſhould have ſtill retired Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. And that we get nothing by a cold Acquaintance; but all things by a warm Acquaintance with him. And ſpeaking of his own experience; ſaid he, <hi>It is my great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet that Chriſt hath ſo little of my company, though I may not ſay, I have not his.</hi> And this was likewiſe manifeſt in thoſe words he uſed in Prayer to this effect. <hi>That the Lord would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109216:20"/> cauſe us to ripen into a greater Knowledge of him, and into a greater Intimacy with him. And that we may have more warm Communion with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in Faith and Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus. And that he would act towards us, according to that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking of his, with the Father on our behalf, before we had a Being. And that our hearts, be actually ſpringing towards him, and be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Myſtery of God in Chriſt; and be brought into the neareſt Intimacy, and Fellowſhip with himſelf, attainable in this Life. That it might be an Earneſt, and Pledge of our everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fruition and Enjoyment of him in the other World.</hi>

            <p>His living in dependence on<note place="margin">His living in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God.</note> God was his conſtant Trade; which alſo the following Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions do evidence. <hi>The Lord make us ſenſible of our weakneſs and inability to help our ſelves. That he would preſerve the Soul in a holy Fear, in its ordinary Walk; leſt it grieve that Spirit, by whoſe power alone it acts: and cauſe the Soul to ſtep forth into the Life of Believing, proſtrating it ſelf at the foot of God; and to ſay, Lord, I can have no Relief, but from thee; and I long for the Effuſion of the Spirit remarkably promiſed in thy Word, and for the Reſurrection of the Body; which now is ſown in Weakneſs, but then 'twill be raiſed in Power: and cry out to be cloathed upon with Power from on high.</hi> And he further ſaid, <hi>That the want
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109216:20"/> of this Conviction of our own Weakneſs, makes us loſe the Juice of Religion.</hi> And that we can no more live by Grace already received, than a Man can live upon his Food the day after he hath eaten it. That therefore <hi>we muſt have the Mouth of our Souls never divided from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, even God himſelf: for we live our Life, our ſpiritual Life upon the Flower of Free Grace only.</hi> And that the Spirit of God would have us to ſee what we are; even, without Strength; that God's Mercy might appear the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and the Goſpel be glorified in its Power; that ſo a poor Chriſtian may be neceſſitated <hi>to believe in and on Jeſus Chriſt, forced into this glorious Sanctuary, made to cling on the Horns of this Altar, and fly to this City of Refuge, as his</hi> Zoar <hi>of Safety.</hi> And he likewiſe ſaid, That could we live in the Faith of this; that God orders every particular thing, and rules all the Affairs of his People; that he hath a ſecret Care of them, and for them under all. That his Providence is never off the Wheel. What Relief would it be? We might then paſs through thick and thin; and it would raiſe the Soul ſtrangely on the Wing. For <hi>Faith, which is the ſence and feeling of the Soul, lies in looking unto God's Power, Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs in the Promiſe.</hi> We have heard much of the Doctrine of Faith; and now God is teaching us the Life of Faith: (This was ſpoken when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109216:21"/> under a very preſſing Affliction.) And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, <hi>That Faith hath no dependence upon the Creature.</hi> Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee, <hi>Pſal. 55. 22. Faith is an adventurous Caſt: Caſt not away thy ſelf, nor thy burthen any where elſe. Oh, that we knew what it were to live in God, to be brought out of our ſelves, and to dwell there no more.</hi> And that we have as great need to lock up our ſelves (as it were) in God when we go to Bed, as to lock up our Doors, if we would be kept from Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults; for we have as much cauſe to fear, leſt Satan, and our depraved Nature, ſhould make a Prey of our Souls; as of Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, leſt they ſhould make a Spoil of our Goods. <hi>Let us therefore give away our ſelves to God, Morning and Evening, and from Evening to Morning; and be always in the Spirit of Faith and Holineſs.</hi> Likewiſe he was obſerved to ſay, that a holy and free Contentment in all God's Dealings, is that we ſhould moſt labour after: for that the happineſs of the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in the bare Enjoyment of any Mercy, but in the God of the Mercy. That if it hath his Preſence, though in the Shadow of Death, it hath content: for outward Good or Miſery is but a fancy, ſeeing we are never the more truly happy, if we have much; or miſerable if we have but little of this World: <hi>But 'tis the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God in any Condition, muſt be our All
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109216:21"/> in all. And that we ſhould make God, and the things of God the natural Centre of the Soul; and all other things we go about, as if we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to it. We make full Experience that we have Juſtifying Faith, when we can truſt God, as well for outward things, as for Pardon of Sin and Salvation. 'Tis a woful Religion we profeſs, when we cannot live upon God, in the want of all things elſe. Wherefore let us not reſt, till we get ſome feeding Fruitfulneſs in ſuch Meditations, and to have the Lord alone exalted in our Souls.</hi> His Expreſſions in Prayer did alſo declare his great Dependence on God: which were to this purpoſe; <hi>That all our Concerns might be upon his heart, and we owned and refreſhed in him. That our Souls might evermore be acted and poſſeſſed by his Spirit. And that he would continue in us a hankering after him, and ſatisfaction in him; giving us in a Cast, in a way of ſpiritual Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Reviving to our Souls. And that we might be under his Care, and kept in his Arms, and walk in his Fear; cauſing our Acquaintance with him to grow and increaſe daily,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He converſed more with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven than Earth, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained<note place="margin">His Heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs.</note> on it. And this was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in his Converſation, and by the Sayings of his Lips; which dropped as an Honey-Comb on all occaſions: and particularly in ſuch words as theſe. <hi>Things viſible are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109216:22"/> of things inviſible, and purely ſpiritual; and therefore inviſible things are the more excellent: for the things which are ſeen, were not made of things that do appear. The Glory of the unſeen Trade of a Chriſtian is not ſo diſcernable now; but the time will come, when all ſeen things ſhall be diſſolved; and then it will ſtand forth. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things of Sence are comfortable to the World; but things unſeen to the People of God, are of a Soul-raiſing Power; mounting the Soul above that which cauſeth Fainting: for thoſe ſpiritual things they look on believingly, as having a real Intereſt in them; elſe they would not give any Relief. And whilſt a Chriſtian hath a ſight of unſeen things by Faith, when great Guſts of Trouble come, there is no room for Fear. Therefore there ſhould be a daily Converſe with unſeen things; and we ſhould not reſt, till we can ſee them with ſome Evidence and Clearneſs. And the Soul ſhould range up and down in this Garden of Delights; not ſuffering that Converſe to cool. And that the entertaining but a little diſtance from God, dulls the ſight of him. And when the Soul is looking with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Intention on Worldly things, it dazles the Eye, as to inviſible Glories: And when it ſuffers any outward Trouble inordinately to bear in, it makes the Eye goggle from that which ſhould fix it. But a good Muſe on things unſeen, would allay, calm, and ſupple the Soul, and make it ſteady in its Courſe. Therefore, Oh, give me things unſeen,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109216:22"/> ſhould we ſay: There let my Share be.</hi> It was further obſerved, that the things of God and Religion became (as it were) natural to him; and (as it hath been ſaid by ſome) that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things flowed from him, as Water from a Fountain: And what he ſpake thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from an inward Sence; and not ſo much from Head and Memory, as from his Heart and Experience: whence an Authority and Luſtre was derived to it.</p>
            <p>His Humility was viſible to<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> all, for he was cloathed with it; there being not the leaſt Appearance of Pride or Vain-Glory, that was diſcernable in him. He had a very mean eſteem of his own Gifts, Parts and Graces. And as he had a low reſpect towards himſelf, ſo, according to Scripture-Precept, he eſteemed others better than himſelf: highly commending the ſmalleſt degree of true Worth in any other, where-ever he ſaw it. And if any carried themſelves unworthily towards him, in Speech or Action, or had injuriouſly treated him, he would take little notice of it, but to requite it with good: He would pity them, and pray for them, and ſtudy how to anſwer them with kindneſs; ſeeking occaſions how to manifeſt his Love to them, according to the Goſpel-Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109216:23"/> Men, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2.) wherein he was a true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and Follower of his Lord and Saviour: who albeit he had great natural Courage, yet it was ſo ſweetned with this Grace, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very Ornamental to him. And in his own Caſe and Concern, he was ſcarce ever ſeen or known to be angry.</p>
            <p>His Patience diſcovered it ſelf<note place="margin">His Patience.</note> much in his laſt Sickneſs; that when great pains were upon him, and of long continuance, he ſeemed to bear all without the leaſt repining. That though he had many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Faintings, yet no inward Frettings. He groaned much, but it was in order to be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon; that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life. He, Dove-like, mourned, but it was unto the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 11. And he lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2. He poured out his Complaint before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 2. but his Complaints were only of, and againſt himſelf; always juſtifying the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and Love of God, in all that he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Which alſo was conſpicuous in the whole Series of his fore-going Life; and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in theſe occaſional Sayings, which iſſued from his rich Mind and heart. <hi>I am more afraid I ſhall not have a full Draught of the Good theſe Trials offer, than that I deſire to be delivered out of them. We in diſtreſs, are apt to mind only our getting out of them; but God minds our Good by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109216:23"/> them. God's deſign in afflicting his People, is purging work; and they ſhould ſtrike in alſo, for the promoting of that deſign; that they may have the Good he aims at by it. We would fain wind out of Trouble; and God would wind us out of the World, and out of our ſelves: that is his End; and bleſſed be his Name, he will accompliſh it.</hi> He was obſerved, under the greateſt outward Loſſes, never to complain; but ſtill to ſay, <hi>Let us labour to improve them, and underſtand the Mind of God in them; and that he did believe, God would cauſe it to work for good.</hi> He often ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, in all his Diſpenſations, though never ſo dark. And reliſhing the neceſſity and excellency of this Grace, he further recommended it to others by many Expreſſions; which were ſuch as theſe. <hi>We ſhould not be as Mopes, and dead things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Afflictions; but lively in the Actings of Faith, Patience and Humility: And that we are not to be aſhamed of them, nor diſcontented under them. That God afflicts us, that we might be more rootedly uſeful, where he gives opportunity after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and to bring us out of our Sins. That as Sin brings us into Trouble, ſo Trouble is ſent to bring us out of Sin, and for the Exerciſe of Grace.</hi> And ſpeaking more particularly; <hi>The Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me out of one Croſs, and fit me for another; for Croſſes I do expect, and the Graces of God's Spirit muſt have Matter for their Exerciſe, while
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109216:24"/> I am in this World.</hi> Moreover, he ſaid, <hi>That we ſhould labour after an even frame of Spirit. And that a Chriſtian ſhould not reſt, till he hath brought his heart to this Indifferency; that under any Trouble or Trial, it be all one to him, whether God doth grant him the things prayed for, or give him Patience, Satisfaction, and Quiet of Spirit in the want of them: and ſo to leave the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to God, for him to make the Choice. And that we ſhould, when under any Confuſion, or Diſorder of Mind, beg of God, that as he once did order and methodize a</hi> Chaos, <hi>and of it did frame a World; ſo he would take thy Confuſions, and ſettle and quiet thy heart: That as he did ſet in order things then, ſo he would deal with thy heart now. And that we ſhould conſider wherein lies the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Redeemed, and the Men of this World: but in this; the one have their Portion here, and the Portion of the other is reſerved.</hi> He further urged theſe <hi>Perſuaſives to Patience, under Afflictive Providences. That God intends our Good</hi> (as before noted:) <hi>And if he aims and deſigns our Good, he will be ſure to ſtrike there, where the voice of his Rod may be heard, and the ſmart of it felt: And will thruſt his Probe into that part moſt feſtered, and ſearch it to the Quick; and cauſe the Corraſive he applies, fully to cleanſe the Wound, before he lays on the healing Plaiſter. And if God ſaw Proſperity to be better for his People than Adverſity, they ſhould not be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109216:24"/> exerciſed with it at all: for God always gives his People the beſt things. And that 'tis pity anything ſhould be matter of Sorrow or Joy unto us now, which will be no Sorrow, nor Increaſe of our Joy in the other World. And that Joy or Sorrow, in the having or loſing outward things, argues that they are our Sun and Shield, and not God: for as a Candle in a Room where the Sun ſhines, 'tis little regarded or minded: That though it be uſed for or about ſome particular uſe or thing, yet 'tis the Sun we live in and by. And that 'tis enough for us to have God for our Treaſure, who is a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Treaſure: Therefore our Eye ſhould be upwards much. And if there be any Joy, it ſhould be on a ſpiritual Account; or any Sorrow, it ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our ſpiritual Trade goes not on. Alſo, that we ſhould conſider, that there be many of God's People come not tot the Trial of their Faith, whilſt they have any outward Prop to reſt upon: But when God reduceth them to the loſs of all, as to the Creature, they ſeeing themſelves in a deſperate Caſe indeed, then God doth his Work upon them; and that is Glorious Work. Yet 'tis a miſerable thing, to make uſe of God, only as a helper in times of Straits and Dangers, when we find Help no where elſe.</hi>

            <p>His Reſignation to God was<note place="margin">His Reſignation to God.</note> his daily Work; and under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Afflictive Providences, was uſed to ſay, <hi>That that was a poor Religion, that could not make a Life
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109216:25"/> of God, abſtracted from all Creatures.</hi> And often he would ſpeak from his own Experience, <hi>That the most undoing Providences were the moſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times to his Soul.</hi> He alſo diſcovered his Proficiency in this excellent part of Godlineſs, in ſuch Directions and Sayings as theſe. <hi>We ſhould give up our ſelves to God in every Petition; and pour out our Souls to him, even as he gives himſelf to us in every Bleſſing. And we ſhould ſo give up our ſelves to God, as never to return to a Carnal Frame and Temper any more: and yield our ſelves to be ordered by him, as a Child that is ordered by its Nurſe. And that the want of a through Surrender of our ſelves to God, makes one lame in all other Duties. Therefore our Religion ſhould not lie only in Notion, but in a total Delivery over of our ſelves to God: And until we come to that clear Reſignation, our Life will always be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to us. And this giving away of our ſelves to God, ſhould be with that perfect Surrender, as not to grieve at the Caſt. Oh!</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>could I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark my ſelf in God, being born up by the Wings of his Spirit, and God guiding the Steerage with his own hand: What need I then fear meeting with Storms! Then no matter at all unto what Port ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I were carried: Then every Croſs, every out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affliction, Trouble, Danger, Loſs, would be my Friend. Did I make God my dwelling place, all the World would be Privileges to me; all things would be turned into Privileges, and redound for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109216:25"/> my good.</hi> Whence alſo he prayed, <hi>That we might come to that clearneſs of Surrender unto God, as to bear a ſtamp and likeneſs to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite kindneſs, Chriſt manifeſted in giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us and to us. That as he did all things willingly, to work out, purchaſe, and procure Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us; ſo we might accept of all the Gracious Offers of his Love, and improve it accordingly. That Renewing Work might be carried on daily. And that we might lanch out of the Circuit of our own Wills, into his Will in all things; and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the Spirit of Chriſt, to a Conformity to him, and growing up in him, as his living Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Natural Courage was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">His Courage and Fortitude.</note> experienced by thoſe that beſt knew him (in his younger Years, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) to have been without blemiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. His Spiritual Courage and Fortitude was diſcerned throughout his Chriſtian Walk, and in theſe following Expreſſions. <q rend="inline">In ſhaking Times, get ſuch a Courage as flows from Faith; and not a meer Manly Proweſs. To be in a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, diſcouraged Frame under Croſſes is bad; and to be joccund out of a meer Manly Stoutneſs and ſo to bear up is ſadder: but a humble ſubmiſſive Carriage, and a Livelineſs nouriſhed by Believing, in going out of our ſelves, and caſting all our Care upon God, who careth for us, is an excellent Frame.</q> And
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109216:26"/> ſpeaking to ſome (who were even ruined by outward Loſſes) he ſaid, <hi>We ſhould have been dead to our Eſtates, when we had them: Let us therefore now be dead to our Diſcouragements, in the want of them. And if we would not be Cowed at every Croſs, let us be ſure to make Death fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and be in a poſture to die every hour. And that will fill the Soul with undaunted Valour and Courage, that nothing ſhall move it: for it is ſence of Guilt, that plucks down the heart, and nothing elſe. And if the Sting of Death (which is Sin) be removed, how bold will the Soul be. And that holy Valour riſes as Difficulties and Dangers riſe; as the Ship upon the top of the Waves, riſeth with the Waves. That 'tis no natural Valour will hold out in a day of Sufferings; but a mortified Frame of Spirit will then abide the Shock. And 'tis the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Chriſtian, not to be faint-hearted under Trials.</hi>

            <p>The excellent Moderation and Temperance of his Spirit was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted<note place="margin">His Moderation and Temperance.</note> in his own Conduct and Behaviour. His Moderation was known unto all Men: His Temperance alſo was interwoven in the Contexture of his whole Walk and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; who being Maſter of his own Paſſions and Affections, was temperate in all things. So that his heart was neither over-charged with the Cares and Incumbrances of this preſent Life, nor enſnared by its Blandiſhments, Senſitive
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109216:26"/> Delights, and Pleaſures; or in any thing that might run into exceſs. And with a ſedate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Mind, he improved all Providential Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, to ripen his Grace and Experience, ſo as to render him uſeful in his Station, for the Good of others, the Glory of God, and his own Profit and Comfort.</p>
            <p>He was a great Redeemer of<note place="margin">His Redemption of Time.</note> Time. That where-ever he came, he endeavoured, as Opportunity offered, to be improving it on the beſt Account; either in holy Conference, or by Counſel and Advice, or in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially where he knew he might be free. And upon that account, by way of Complaint, he once ſaid, <hi>How uſeleſs and helpleſs are we one unto another, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Souls; but in other Affairs, there our hearts can eaſily mix, and run one into another.</hi> And his Carriage and Behaviour was with ſuch a Graceful Authority, tempered with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility, and Reſpect to all, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Rank and Degree; that even in his Minority, he was both loved and admired for his extraordinary Activity in all Religious Concerns. And he won exceedingly upon the hearts of moſt that converſed with him, in and about ſpiritual things; leaving a ſweet ſavour behind him, where-ever he came. And this was never perceived to abate or decay; but continued in its Vigour, and Fervour, even to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109216:27"/> Old Age. In his Childhood, and ſo forwards, he was an Enemy to all vain and idle Paſs-time; but ſtill ſtriving to be receiving or doing good to his Power. And until he was hindred and prevented, by bodily Diſtempers, and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Old Age, he would be both early and late, induſtriouſly painful and unwearied in the Concerns of his own Soul; allowing no more time for Sleep, Food, or any other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Refreſhments, than was abſolutely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. That when all the Family beſides were in Bed, and faſt aſleep, he made choice of that time, as a ſweet Repaſt to him, for Reading, Meditation, and ſecret Prayer. And it was his uſual Cuſtom (which very rarely was omitted) when he went to take his Reſt, to have a Light ſtanding by his Bed-ſide, and his Bible before him; and as he lay in Bed, to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it; muſing on ſome Scripture or other for a conſiderable time, ere he would compoſe himſelf to Reſt. Which occaſionally, a Friend in the ſame Room, once obſerving, asked him how he could poſſibly refrain, all that time, from Sleep. Unto which he replied to this effect: <hi>That the things he read and conſidered of were ſo ſerious, that they would not ſuffer him to ſleep, whilſt his Thoughts were therein exerciſed.</hi> And he had ſuch a Command of the Temper of his Mind and Body, that there was not ſeen in him any Oppreſſion of Drowſineſs, whenever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109216:27"/> he was actually concerned in the performance of any ſolemn ſpiritual Duty. And to obviate and prevent ſuch Indiſpoſure, his Care was, to ſet apart the fitteſt Seaſon for Religious Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. That inſtead of <hi>the torn, lame and corrupt thing ſpoken of in</hi> Mal. 1. 13, 14. <hi>the beſt part of his Time and Strength was devoted, and offered up to the Lord in Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Heart-fixedneſs in Duty<note place="margin">His Heart-fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Duty.</note> further diſcovered it ſelf in this one Paſſage; That his Judgment being deſired, whether or no, in Hearing, and joyning with others in the Duty of Prayer, one might ſtrive to charge the Memory with any ſelect Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions uttered by the Speaker; he replied only this, <hi>I ſhould not then have my End in that Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was <hi>a Companion of all them</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Company and Converſe.</note> 
               <hi>that feared God; and the Saints, and Excellent of the Earth were all his delight:</hi> That of Choice, he deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with no other. And when he knew not well the Company that occaſionally he was among, he was ſomewhat unfree to ſpeak, but would rather hear others, than ſpeak himſelf; though he wanted not Skill, to deliver himſelf in proper Phraſe, and in the moſt apt Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And when at any time, good things were ſpoken of, where he was preſent; if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they proceeded not from a heart, in the Speaker, duly affected with the things
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109216:28"/> themſelves, it ſeemed very irkſome to him: And he would be frequently urging ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, either in expreſs words, or by ſome other hints, to be ſure, <hi>That they were in the Life, Power, and Practice of the ſerious Truths they ſpake of; for that otherwiſe, he accounted it but the taking of God's holy Name in vain.</hi> He was an inward Friend to all he judged Gracious, of what Perſuaſion ſoever: for 'twas the Image of Chriſt, and Truth of Grace he looked at; and where he perceived that in any Perſon, there his Love went out, and his heart was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared unto ſuch, without further Enquiry. And when-ever he was in the Society of any, of what Rank or Degree ſoever, if their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe tended to unprofitableneſs, was Jejune and taſteleſs (though in it ſelf not ſinful) yet he would ſeek to free himſelf from them, ſo ſoon as ever he could: and he would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complaining, <hi>how his Soul ſuffered all that while.</hi> He alſo much diſ-liked the Converſation of thoſe who were addicted to needleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; or ſuch who manage Diſputes about Religious Affairs, from Pride and Self-Intereſt, with Paſſion and Strife of Words; and not out of a Love to the things themſelves: which he judged to be extreamly pernicious, whilſt the Heats of ſuch Diſputes cool the inward Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Soul to ſpiritual things, and all the Warmth of the heart turns into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109216:28"/> and Air of empty Notion. For though he was one naturally inclined, and much given to conſider the reaſon of things; and throughly to inform his Judgment, in Points both Civil, Moral, and Religious: (And to that end he affected to be preſent at ſuch Arguings, which tended to find out, diſcover, and make plain uſeful Truths.) Yet he had a great Averſaſion to, and did much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Litigious and wrangling Debates; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far from advancing Religion or Holineſs, as that it did principally ariſe from a decay of the ſame, and want of the Sence and powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof. And thence, according to the Rule of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> he would ſtudiouſly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to <hi>withdraw himſelf, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 4, 5. and was wont to ſay of Perſons he eſteemed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, Judicious, and Savoury; <hi>That ſuch and ſuch were Juicy Chriſtians; Trees of the Lord full of Sap:</hi> whoſe Society he greatly prized.</p>
            <p>His Charity in Caſe of Evil<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> Reports, was ſingular. He was very ſhy and unwilling, to hear or receive an evil Report of others, much leſs of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to mention it; and principally, if he judged them to be ſincere in the main. He had a great diſlike of a Cenſorious Humour, which ſome who are truly good, through In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertence and Temper, are too much addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to (not watching againſt it as they ought to do) contrary to that Meekneſs of Chriſt,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109216:29"/> which he did continually endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. And when he ſaw it needful to condemn the Actions of any ſuch, yet he would ſhew Candor and Reſpect to their Perſons; either by concealing their Names, or in putting the beſt Conſtruction upon what was ſaid or done as far as the matter would bear. And he would commend and cheriſh the leaſt true Good he ſaw in any. And in caſe of private Wrongs, he adviſed thus; <hi>Forgive private Wrongs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you reprove them: Forgive the Wrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you repair your ſelf upon the doer of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was <hi>rich in good Works, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Liberality.</note> 
               <hi>to diſtribute, willing to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</hi> And as 'tis ſpoken of the <hi>Macedonians, not only according to, but beyond his power, he was willing to relieve Perſons in diſtreſs;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>thoſe who were of the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> And he did very much grieve when he could do no more. The Sin of Covetouſneſs was not at all ſeen in him: and he would ſay, <hi>'Tis a brave thing to be Large-hearted, if done in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith and Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he exhorted any, it<note place="margin">His Faithfulneſs in Adviſing and Reproving.</note> was with weight and ſeriouſneſs; and when he reproved any, it was with great reſpect to their Perſons, according to their Quality and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; yet would not ſpare, cloſely and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to blame what was reprovable in them: and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109216:29"/> he often bewail'd Peoples Unfaithfulneſs, in the Omiſſion of that Commanded Duty. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he miſliked their ſinful forwardneſs, in bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing abroad the Failings of others, before they had obſerved Scripture-Order, in dealing with them more privately.</p>
            <p>Sympathy and Compaſſion<note place="margin">His Sympathy and Compaſſion.</note> were deeply rooted in his heart, and eminently exerciſed in his Life: that in a great degree, it may be ſaid of him, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake; <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and I burn not?</hi> And peculiarly towards his unconverted Relations. Oh, how bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly would he, upon all occaſions, be ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deplorable Condition before the Lord? And with reſpect to outward Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on any of his Friends, he was moſt feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected. That in writing to a Kinſwoman of the death of her Husband, he uſed theſe words at the Cloſe of his Letter; <hi>I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large at this preſent, for every word I write, makes my heart to ake.</hi> And when a near Relation of his lay very ſick, and in great pain, he told a Friend of his, how much affected he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and <hi>that he could not ſay which was in greater Anguiſh, and ſuffered moſt; himſelf with the ſympathizing ſence of that pain, or his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that did perſonally and immediately bear the ſame.</hi> And further, in the hearing of the ſame Friend, ſpeaking of this Grace; he ſaid, <hi>If we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109216:30"/> could make others Diſtreſſes our own by Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling, we might get Good by their Afflictions as if we our ſelves were in their Caſe. And that we ſhould by Sympathy, as much as we may, die with every one that dies; and that would make us ſerious Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Contracts and Dealings<note place="margin">His Moral Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</note> he was very wary not to exact up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neceſſities of any in buying or ſelling; or to act by any indirect way whatſoever (noted in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 14.) but ever obſerving that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Rule of our Saviour, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 12. And when he had hired, or made uſe of Perſons, in any Work or Labour; he would not only pay them their due, which was agreed to, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but moſt frequently he would give them ſomewhat over and above; eſpecially if he judged them to be poor and needy.</p>
            <p>That whilſt he had bodily<note place="margin">His Diligence in his Calling, with a holy Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit therein.</note> Strength and Health to manage Worldly Employments, he was always active and induſtrious therein; and he could not be ever charged with any wilful Omiſſion: Yet all the while he had his Mind ſo compoſed, that he was ever in a readineſs to a due and regular Attendance on the ſolemn Duties of his high Calling; not ſuffering any outward Occurrence, of what kind ſoever, to diſtract or unſettle his Mind. But when he approached to God, in the actual
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109216:30"/> Exerciſe of any Religious Duties, he was ſtill furniſhed with ſuch variety of Matter, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Rhetorick, as if all his preceding time had been taken up, in and about ſpiritual Work: Such was the habitual Frame of his Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heavenly things. And he gave this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; <hi>That we ſhould do Worldly Buſineſs, with Diligence, Patience, Moderation, and Faith; and with ſuch a ſelf-denying reſpect, as if it were the ſole Intereſt and Concern of another, rather than our own. And when we would make a Judgment of our ſelves or Actions in matters doubtful, we ſhould put our ſelves in the Room of a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His great Love to the Church<note place="margin">His Love to the Church and People of God.</note> and People of God rendred him a reſtleſs Supplicant and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in Prayer for them. That upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Immergency, relating to the Church of Chriſt in general, or any Member thereof in particular; even for ſuch whom he never knew or ſaw, on the firſt notice of their Diſtreſſes, he would be wreſtling with God in ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. And if other Chriſtians were (at ſuch a time) near, or occaſionally preſent, he would be alſo urging them to the ſame Work; ſaying, <hi>Come, let us lift up our joynt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to God for them.</hi> And this at any time of the day; and conſtantly at ſet times for Prayer, he preſented their Caſe and Concern moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109216:31"/> before the Lord, as a thing which always lay very much on his heart. And for the Church of Chriſt in general, his Petitions were obſerved to be ſuch as theſe: <hi>That God would viſit</hi> Zion, <hi>the whole Church, and viſible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt here in this World. That it might be a Glory in all the Earth. That as he hath taken hold of the Plough, he would carry on his own Work. That he would look upon his Son, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Covenant, look upon that Redemption he hath contrived and deſigned, for the bringing in of Souls unto himſelf, to beſtow his own Free Grace upon, in making them Veſſels of Mercy and Glory. That his Church might proſper, and every faithful Member of it; and become Glorious in Holineſs. That the Son of Righteouſneſs would break forth, and ſparkle upon it. That his Ordinances might be maintained, his Goſpel run and be glorified, and get Ground every where. That God would tender his People as the Apple of his Eye, as a Royal Diadem in his hand, and as the Object of his Delight. That he would give a mighty Check and a dreadful Rebuke unto the fury of all ſuch as bear ill Will to</hi> Zion: <hi>And that all Oppoſitions and Combuſtions againſt his Intereſt, might tend to the Advancement of it, of his Glory, and the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Goſpel. That Holineſs might ſpread it ſelf throughout the World, and the Mouth of Iniquity be ſtopt in all the Earth. That all that Enmity againſt God and his People, which hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109216:31"/> been in the World, ever ſince the Infection crept into our Natures, from Satan, the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, might be deſtroyed, and come to an end. That his People might glory in his great Salvation, procured and purchaſed by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt on their behalf. That he would rule in the midſt of his Enemies; bearing down the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wickedneſs, and all the Contrivers of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. That he would remember his People under ſore Trials, and be in the midſt of the Storm; and ſay unto them,</hi> It is I, be not afraid; <hi>and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for every Shock they ſhall meet withal, before the Son of Man appeareth. That the Throne of his Grace be lifted up, and the Riſe of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made conſpicuous. That the Sceptre of Jeſus Chriſt might ſway it ſelf, and become Glorious; Counter-working all the Wiſdom and crafty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Serpent's Seed. And that he would not ſuffer his People to be in any Pit, out of which his Arm cannot help them. That he would keep his Miniſters, as Stars, in his Right Hand; that his Enemies, which are as the Tail of the Dragon, might not ſcatter them. That all his People might be enabled to meditate Terrour, and not be afraid, when he ſhall ariſe to ſhake terribly the Earth. That Salvation might be for Walls round about his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that God would cauſe his Glory to ſhine forth. That God would ſave theſe Nations with a mighty Salvation, and undertake for his own Glory in the midſt thereof. That for ſuch as are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109216:32"/> under Bonds of Guilt, he would deliver them by his Reſcuing, Pardoning Grace. That he would be mindful of thoſe under inward Trouble, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Pollutions within, and Wounds of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from without. That ſpiritual Objects might be great in their ſight; and that he would bring them out, with ſome notable advantage, over all the Powers of Darkneſs, that lay Siege againſt their Faith and Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His whole Life atteſted the Tenderneſs of his Conſcience;<note place="margin">His Tenderneſs of Conſcience.</note> and it was particularly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in theſe two Inſtances. <hi>Firſt,</hi> When he had at any time, Moneys lying by him to any value, he would lend the ſame, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a Penny Intereſt. And when-ever he received any Intereſt, he would be ſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it wholly in charitable and pious Uſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whilſt he had Trading abroad, on all Goods Exported and Imported, he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful of paying the full Duty or Cuſtom, thereon rated and required, without Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>His high Eſteem of the Grace<note place="margin">His high Eſteem of Repentance and Applications to Chriſt.</note> of Repentance, with his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Chriſt, ſhewed it ſelf, in his frequent lamenting Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Sin, and praying for great meaſures of Repentance for himſelf: and exhorted others to the ſame neceſſary Work. And he was a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109216:32"/> diligent Searcher, and curious watchful Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his own heart: who could not bear with any Guilt, but would make freſh Applications to the Blood of Sprinkling; ſaying, <hi>To be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Guilt was ſad; but when we are laden in the ſence of it, if we carry this Guilt to Chriſt, and venture on him for Pardon and Mercy, we ſhall not be caſt out. And how it was an evil and a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing to depart from God; but far more bitter to ſtay away from God, when we have departed from him.</hi> And to this effect he expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Prayer; <hi>That by Nature we are averſe to the Convictions of God's Spirit in his Word; and Satan is ever blowing up his Spawn and Seed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, whereby to ſpoil our Taſte and Reliſh of things pure and ſpiritual; and interrupt our Peace and Communion with God. And therefore that God would cauſe us more clearly to diſcern the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Malignity of that Evil that is in our Natures, and make us to know all our Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whatever is repugnant to his holy Nature and Will, both in our Hearts and Lives; and make us freely ſenſible of, throughly aſhamed, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and humbled for the ſame. That he would raiſe us up to a greater Antipathy againſt all that, that is diſpleaſing to him, and hurtful to our Souls. And that no Intereſt might hinder or ſqueeze out the working of his Grace within us, as not to have Freedom to act. And that all that might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, that would interrupt the Intercourſe of his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109216:33"/> Spirit with our hearts. And that he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to ſpare and indulge any Corruption, or leave any corner of our hearts, wherein Sin may be at Peace. That no</hi> Agag <hi>be permitted to live in us. That his Fear might Garriſon our hearts, againſt all the Invaſions, and prevailing power of our own Corruptions. And that Satan by his Wiles, might not ſweeten us into any Bonds of Guilt. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are apt to grow hard continually, and it is God's Power alone, that can ſoften, help and heal; that he would cauſe us to experience the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Power of his Grace in our Souls; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all new, and refining us every moment. That we might get into Jeſus Chriſt, and make him now our Advocate, who will be our Judge. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we need Converting, and new Creating ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; that Regeneration-work might paſs upon us continually; and we made all over new, and be prepared for all his Concerns. That he would bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize us into the Grace of the Goſpel, and cauſe us to live anſwerable to ſo high a Calling as that is. That we might be baptized evermore, into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Spirit; and ſo receive Life and Quickening from Jeſus Chriſt, who is our Head. And when our Guilt is upon us; That the Lord would keep our hearts tender, to feel the ſmart of Sin; and ſo haſten to our Phyſician, to be bound up, and healed: And not ſuffer our Wounds to wrankle and feſter, for want of coming to him for Pardon and Cleanſing. That he would make us go
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109216:33"/> out to him, and never neglect or keep aloof from his Recovering Grace; elſe we ſhall provoke him more and more, by undervaluing the Riches of his Grace; and refuſing the Remedy he hath provided for Sinners. That he would make up every Breach, and cauſe us to be all over plunged in the Fountain opened for Sin and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Scripture reveals<note place="margin">His Proficiency in Grace.</note> and promiſes; <hi>That the Root of the Righteous yieldeth Fruit: And whoſe Hope the Lord is, ſhall not ceaſe from yielding Fruit. That the Godly Man ſhall bring forth Fruit in his Seaſon; and in Old Age, ſhall be fat and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And he that abideth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him; the ſame bringeth forth much Fruit,</hi> was in an extraordinary meaſure fulfilled in him. And all thoſe Heavenly Doctrines, and Practicable Truths which he underſtood, believed, and profeſſed, he lived over. His Practice agreed, and held pace with his Principles. That what his head apprehended, his heart affected, his Will embraced, his Life manifeſtly declared and publiſhed. And when bodily Strength de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, yet his ſpiritual Vigour ſtill remained: And <hi>his Bow abode in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were made ſtrong, by the Hands of the mighty God of</hi> Jacob. And ſuch was his Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in well doing, that thoſe who at any time diſcourſed him about Soul-Concerns; it was their own Fault and Omiſſion, if they parted from him without ſome real benefit.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:109216:34"/>
            <p>His frequency in Meditation was very remarkable. Whence<note place="margin">His frequency in Meditation.</note> he was noted often to ſay, that, <hi>That Soul could not thrive much in Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that was not much in Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Freedom from Envy, and diſtracting Cares was obvious to<note place="margin">His Freedom from Envy and diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cares.</note> thoſe who knew him beſt, in the general Courſe of his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whence alſo he was obſerved to ſay, <hi>I bleſs God, I have no Temptation at all to envy others Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: and 'tis a great favour from the Lord, that I have much freedom from Anxious Thoughts, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God will do with me, as to my outward Condition, and being in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His inward Tranquility, Peace, and Joy was patent to all, ſo far as<note place="margin">His inward Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, Peace and Joy.</note> it could be outwardly diſcerned; not letting fall, in the obſervation of any that were moſt converſant with him, the leaſt word of repining at any time: And 'tis alſo ratified by theſe Suggeſtions which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to others from his own experience; with the way how to attain it; ſaying, <hi>The Lord never made Fleſh and Blood, to be a Weapon to conquer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency: The Soul muſt eſcape from all Creature-Refuges, if ever it will have true quiet. That if a Man will have ſolid Peace and Content, he muſt firſt have God to be his God; for true Peace and Quiet is in him alone. That a Man cloathed with Rags, may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109216:34"/> have as much inward Content and Satisfaction, and far more, than the richeſt and greateſt man in the World: for our Happineſs lies in the right Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Mind, and not in the greatneſs of any outward Condition. And that whatever befalls us in this World, is ordinarily, ſo far ſweet or bitter to us, as we fancy it to be. That as outward Profit makes the trouble of any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking ſweet to the Man that proſpers in the World, ſo if we could live in the faith of this, that all things ſhall work for good, we ſhould be as much ſatisfied under Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as in the greateſt Worldly Proſperity.</hi> And he would often ſay when he returned home, from amongſt the Perſons and Affairs of this World; <hi>That he had no quiet, till he had poured out his Soul to God in Prayer:</hi> And if there he did not meet with him inſtantly, yet ſtill he had no Peace, till he had regained the Preſence of God again. And <hi>that walking with God was the joy and delight of his Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Self-denial ſhewed it ſelf,<note place="margin">His Self-denial.</note> in his Humility, Dependence on God, Mortification, Reſignation, and Heavenly mindedneſs; which hath been before declared. And to this purpoſe he adviſed, <hi>That we ſhould ceaſe from our ſelves, and ſo think, ſpeak and do in the name of Chriſt. That all our Thoughts, Speeches, and Actions ſhould be managed by us, as the Thoughts, Words, and Actions of Jeſus Chriſt; for by going out of our ſelves, we are made his, and he is made
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109216:35"/> ours. Ah, there is very little Christianity in the World. I would be for God while I live, and for Heaven when I die. Mine own ſtrength never did me good. Faith abhors all manner of Aid that Fleſh and Blood can give: It undoes a poor Creature in a ſaving manner. There is a holy venturing on God: Little do we think how kindly God takes it, when we throw our ſelves upon him: ſuch a venturous Soul is always acceptable to him. Oh, for ſome awakening Viſit from Heaven, that may alarm us out of our ſelves, into the City of Refuge, before we are benighted.</hi> He alſo prayed, <hi>That the Lord would come into us with Triumph, and trample down whatever is oppoſite to the Purity of his Nature, in our Souls. And in regard all our miſchief ariſeth from the unmortifiedneſs of our Wills; and our Sores and Wounds, and the grieving of God's Spirit is cauſed by a ſinful Indulgence towards them; and the exerciſe of our faith, love, and all other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is ſuſpended, when we are lead Captive by them; that therefore the Lord would ſave us from a ſelfiſh, fleſhly Will, and divorce us wholly from it: and then when we come to die, the ſeparation of the Soul from the Body will be but a ſmall thing to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Thankfulneſs to, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing<note place="margin">His Thankfulneſs to God, with Praiſe and Bleſſing.</note> of God, was obſerved to be his continual Exerciſe. He was not known at any time to murmur under the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Trials; but would evermorre be juſtifying God, praiſing and ſpeaking well of his Name, and perſuading others to do the like. And he greatly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109216:35"/> delighted to praiſe God in ſinging of Pſalms, eſpecially on the Lord's Day; and he much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed, and blamed the great neglect of it, in this preſent Age.</p>
            <p>He had a great Eſteem and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration<note place="margin">His Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Superiors.</note> for Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as being a Divine Ordinance: and did highly diſapprove and condemn thoſe, who did manifeſt the leaſt Contempt thereof. And would pray for the Supream Powers, according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Rule.</p>
            <p>His Thoughts and Meditations<note place="margin">His Meditations on Death.</note> were much on his laſt Change. And thereupon he would frequently take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak ſomething concerning Death; to awaken both himſelf and others, to a due and ſerious Preparation for it; in ſuch Sayings as theſe. <hi>That we are ſhortly to remove hence, &amp; take our flight; when the Volume of the Book will be cloſed up, and the Miniſtration of Grace will be at an end. There muſt now be through work, in giving away our ſelves to God; elſe 'twill be a diſmal day when we come to die. Death will make us to have other manner of thoughts of things, than we have now: Death will repreſent things in other Colours; 'twill ſtretch every Vein, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly. We ſhould live always as thoſe that have hope towards God when they die; and that are ready every day, to ſtep out of one World, into another. That ſuch a flying to Chriſt, as is accompanied with a Reſignation of our Wills to his Will, is the beſt Preparative for our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109216:36"/> Change. When I am going to leave the Body, if I have not an Ark to fly unto, I muſt periſh in the Water. We are going to live with Spirits, where will be no body at all to converſe with; and what a Life is that! Let us then always follow the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Conduct of the Spirit here. We ſhould by Sympathy, as much as we may, die with every one that dies; and that would make us ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. We muſt ſhortly leave this World; and becauſe we are not willing to part with it, God tears it off, that himſelf may be all in all. We are lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the World apace, and our laſt Change is near; only I would not have it come as an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Surprize. God did not deliver the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of old, but by Death: and ſo he may do by us. And what a wretched frame of heart have we, that we are ſo eaſily ſatisfied, to leave ſome things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our greateſt Concern always undone: Some little ſomething (as we account it) ſtill to do? But when we come to die, and to leave the World, how will that ſwell at ſuch an hour? I know no Terror greater, than for a Man to go out of the World, out of God, and out of Chriſt; and yet the moſt do ſo.</hi> And when at that time he was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Perſon preſent, <hi>Your Caſe is not ſo;</hi> he replied, <hi>It is an amazing Mercy: I am won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſaved.</hi> And he further ſaid, <hi>Time of Health is the Opportunity: The great things of the Souls Intereſt, in Sickneſs, or on a dying Bed, is a bad time to manage.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:109216:36"/>
            <p>He lived much in an Exerciſe<note place="margin">His Proſpect of Glory.</note> of Faith, upon the Glory of the future State; which was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Support and Comfort to his Spirit: and he did continually take in large Views and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of it. Whence he was obſerved to ſay, before his laſt Sickneſs; That he had ſuch an IDEA of the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that (he thought) he could furniſh a Book with fit Matter, on that <hi>Glorious Subject.</hi>
            </p>

Which fully appears in his laſt Speeches and Prayers: Continuing in a lively and vigorous Exerciſe of Spiritual and Heavenly Graces (eſpecially Faith, Hope, Patience, Self-Reſignation, full Aſſurance, and Longing to be with the Lord) to the laſt period of his Life; when <hi>Grace</hi> iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>an abundant Entrance was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to him, into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109216:39"/> God's part thereby; for diſcharging of which, he is made a high Prieſt; and ſo he procures it, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, in the power of a King, and reveals it as a Prophet: all which Offices he was anointed to, and qualified for, in his own Perſon. And by reaſon of that Eſſential Union with the Godhead, in which he ſtood, the Father delights in, and owns him as Son of Man; and doth every way ſuit with him, as the Father of ſuch a Son, who is both God and Man. The Spirit alſo, which proceedeth from the Father and the Son, doth (through the ſame Union of the Divine Eſſence) alſo ſuit with him, and operate by and through him, as the Spirit of him who is both God and Man in one Perſon. Hence ariſeth the Perfection and abſolute Compleatneſs of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip; <hi>I am not alone,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but I and the Father that ſent me,</hi> Joh. 8. 16. <hi>And the comforting Spirit ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you,</hi> Joh. 16. 14. <hi>For the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in him</hi> (bodily,) Col. 2. 9. and joyntly, and carries on the work of Mediatorſhip; which was perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untertook by the Eternal Son, who is made <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel.</hi> And this anſwers the Queſtion which <hi>Philip</hi> made; <hi>Shew us the Father. Haſt thou not ſeen me?</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>He that hath ſeen me, (viz.</hi> by the eye of Faith, as I really am and ought to be looked upon) <hi>hath ſeen the Father,</hi> Joh. 14. 7. Every Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Revelation of himſelf, is the Revelation of the Father, Son and Spirit, in the diſtinguiſhable working of each Perſon, and yet united in the ſame God, <hi>who worketh all in all.</hi> Chriſt ſuffered as the Son of ſuch a Father, and the Father (in this deſign of Mediatorſhip) was cloathed with a true Fatherly Relation, to the incarnate ſuffering Son; and the Eternal Spirit, which proceedeth from the Father
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109216:40"/> and the Son, did put forth his Almighty Eſſential Vertue, in the offering up of the Body of Chriſt upon the Croſs: Which Union of Father, Son and Spirit, in God our Saviour (<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13.) appears in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. So that all the Perſons, in the ſaving of Man, doth (as it were) concenter, and work together in the Perſon of the Mediator. The Will of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 34. The Mercy of the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13, 14. And the Power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. All which being one in the Divine Eſſence of God, meet together in the Perſon of the Son, who is, according to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Decree, God and Man, through his Union with and in the Godhead.</p>
            <p>God thus manifeſted in the Fleſh, and, as Father, Son and Spirit, laying the foundation of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Jeſus Chriſt, the Eternal Son, God and Man, doth alſo, in and with him, carry it on, as a Father to, and Spirit of him, who is God-man. And for this cauſe the Goſpel is called <hi>the Word of Truth;</hi> in reſpect, not only of the Matter of it, but the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Teſtimony that it receives from theſe three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as the Declaration of the Counſel of their own Eſſential Will and Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And in regard the Son of God, in the Name and Co-working of Father, Son, and Spirit, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Mediatorſhip by taking Man's Nature, every mortal perſon that has the nature of Man, ſtands alike near to him, in the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel-Call. It puts aſide other Mediators: The Angels are Spirits, and have not Humane Nature, in which to mediate for Man: Chriſt himſelf is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to us than they are; he is Man. The Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect, cannot mediate for us; for though they are Humane, yet they want living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109216:40"/> but Chriſt has his Humane Body with him; and therefore is nearer to Men, who are cloathed with Fleſh. Neither can one mortal Man, mediate as a Mediator 'twixt God and Man, becauſe though he have the Humane Nature in him, yet it is in him perſonally, and not repreſenting the whole Race of Man; as the pure Nature of Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> doth: And beſides, Mortal Man is but Man; but Chriſt is both God and Man, that he might lay his hand on both parties, God and Man, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them together, as they are reconciled in the Perſon of the Mediator, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21, 22. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes cannot mediate; for Man has no right to them, but through Chriſt firſt. Duties cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate; becauſe they are loathſome, without a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Intereſt in Chriſt. Graces cannot mediate, becauſe they are Fruits of Reconciliation through the Mediator; the Fruit cannot be the cauſe of the Root from whence they come.</p>
            <p>So that as Jeſus Chriſt, in being Mediator, took our Nature (<hi>viz.</hi> that Humane Nature that is in every perſon of Mankind) into immediate Union with the Godhead dwelling in his Perſon, ſo this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, God and Man (in the Relation he bears to the Father and Spirit, and they to him, in their mutual concurrence in this great work of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) with him, having ſealed and anointed him thereto, that he might compleatly effect it, he is the true immediate Object of a Believer's eye; and he who (renouncing all other names and helps) flies thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall be ſaved by him, <hi>Act. 4. 12. He that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, ſhall have everlaſting life.</hi> His appearing in the Promiſes doth make them a Convoy to bring the Soul to him; which would otherwiſe, be no better Guides, than the Light to a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109216:41"/> blind Man. His preſence in Duties makes them the way and door of approach; which would otherwiſe be no better Guides (by ſingle gazing on, and uſing of them) than a Lanthorn in a Man's hand, can be a Guide by gazing on it; and leading himſelf round about in a Circle, by the light thereof, not minding the way, or the door, to find which, that light was appointed and intended.</p>
            <p>The Graces of his Spirit are the Beams of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is in his Perſon, and the Streams which flow from the Fountain, which are ſubject to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and ſtoppage, without the conſtant ſupply, which they receive from the Sun, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And therefore, a Biliever's eye and aim muſt be tending to an immediate pitching on, and cloſing with himſelf, as the proper courſe and ſure way, and only orderly means to find reſt and ſafety to the Soul.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, to enquire, how the Eye of Faith<note place="margin">The Aim of Faiths Eye deſirous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Mark.</note> is to be levelled at, and exerciſed upon this perfect and glorious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo as to change the Soul, from bearing the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of its own guilt, and to get power againſt the defiling nature and power of ſin; and ſo to carry on the change, from Glory to Glory, after the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, by the vertue of his Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>The Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is the Glaſs; the Glory of the Lord there appearing, is that which Faith fixeth and feedeth upon: it paſſeth through the Glaſs, and ſeizeth upon Jeſus Chriſt, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein; and there ſtays, till it hath enamoured the Soul into the ſame likeneſs. The Glory of Chriſt begets an Image of Glory in the heart of a Believer, of the ſame nature with its ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:109216:41"/>
            <p>Indeed, there is a tranſient cloſing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as with a Neighbour, who can tell where the Souls Friend dwelleth; and ſo do the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and ſo far the Spirit of the Father lodgeth in them, for the help of the diligent ſeeker, to draw him to Chriſt. The firſt motion alſo of that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſeeking proceedeth from the Father, who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Son, by the Spirit, to draw the Soul (in true method) to the Perſon of the Son, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; in whom the Father, Son and Spirit gives the Soul a ſatisfactory Meeting, <hi>Joh. 5. 17. c.</hi> 6. 44, 45. and <hi>c.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
            <p>But the Knot of Union, by which the Soul par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the Life and Glory of God, is not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knit, till the Soul actually enters into the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, the Mediator, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. and for this very end, ſerves the preaching of the Goſpel, in the Diſpenſation of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28.</p>
            <p>The Soul being thus uſhered in, treats with, and fixeth on Chriſt abſolutely and immediately, and lays hold on his Perſonal Worth only, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of its hope and help. The Soul has gained a great deal of Beauty in Chriſt's Eye, when once 'tis brought by his Spirit, to leave its own Idols, and forſake its own Country, and to truſt ſingly under the ſhadow of his Wings, there Bleſſedneſs begins; as <hi>Boaz</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ruth, Ruth</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>And here the Soul cloſeth with the All-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Mediator, pondering the large extent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And whereas the Soul is uſually more troubled with the Aggravations of ſin, and the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, than about the ſin it ſelf, and about its inſincerity and want of feeling remorſe, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent deteſtation againſt ſin, in its repentance, and much moleſted with the ſtain that Guilt leaves on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109216:42"/> the Conſcience; and finding, that neither remove of Guilt, nor power of Cleanſing, nor freedom from its juſt Accuſation, can be got from the Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounded Spirit, it falls nakedly on the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the Mediator; and there it beholds him, as one able to take away all ſins, in their whole extent. His Body was given him for that end: and although his own Body was pure, yet it was in the likeneſs of the fleſh of ſin, or ſinful fleſh, and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Nature, received from <hi>Adam;</hi> that as far as any motions of ſin, or capacity of ſinning is found in Mankind, he did bear the likeneſs of that State. And ſo is called the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> not only as one repreſenting the Elect Seed of Grace, but alſo as being the <hi>Superadequate</hi> Antidote, to conquer and remove all Poyſon that entred upon Mankind by the ſin of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> The Nature of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is made as perfectly holy, as the firſt was defiled by ſin, and became perfectly ſinful, as appears in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. And in regard the ſtrength and ſlaying power of ſin lies in the Law, his Humane Nature was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, ſubjected to the whole Law, as far as it had to do with ſinful Man, for this end, that he might redeem them who were under the Law, from being under any condemning or accuſing Sentence, or ſting of puniſhment from thence; which he bringeth about by obeying it, &amp; ſatisfying for the breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, made by ſinful Man. Sin is therefore ſin, becauſe 'tis againſt the Law; he therefore is made under the Law, and that to fulfil its Commands, and bear its doom. Though ſin be finite in the Tranſgreſſor, yet 'tis infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in reſpect of the Object, the infinite God. But the Obedience and Suffering of Chriſt, was of an infinite extent in reſpect of the Perſon, becauſe 'twas the Act of God-man; and in the Vertue alſo, becauſe 'twas a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109216:42"/> contrived Remedy, in the Council of God's Love, to outſtretch the injury that was done to the infinite Divine Majeſty, by finite Man. Hence it is, that this Remedy carries with it the Terms of Abounding Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 20. and unſearchable Riches, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 8. The All-ſufficiency lies alſo in this, that 'tis a free Gift, conſidering that the Gifts of God's Love are infinite, as his Nature is; the thoughts of which do, by Faith, bring in a Foundation for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Juſtification and Righteouſneſs; and makes way to the reſt of the purchaſed Poſſeſſion, that lies in the Perſon of the ſame Redeemer; the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Goodneſs, and Drift in this deſign, which could never ſuffer diſappointment; the infiniteneſs of his Wiſdom, that could never miſtake; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs of his Love, that can never ceaſe, nor Power fail.</p>
            <p>And ſince the Nature of the Salvation of God is infinite, it is brought down into the Perſon of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and from him, into the Ordinances; and ſo by the Spirit, into the heart of Man; retaining ſtill its infinite Nature. In Jeſus Chriſt, the infinite God is made Fleſh, in the Ordinances, he ſpeaks by Man's Voice, in the faith of the heart he dwelleth; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Soul (by the Operation of his Spirit, to look upon him, and hear his Voice in the ſteps of his Condeſcention) to the true enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis comfortable to have the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony<note place="margin">Faith taking a right Method.</note> of a good Conſcience, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 15. and power over Corruption, and Soul-diſquiet thereby: but I muſt not begin there. God begins my Righteouſneſs and Freedom in himſelf, and brings it forth in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt: I muſt begin it there alſo; and as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109216:43"/> in him, I muſt perfectly ſuck it thence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing perpetually at that Breaſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expecting to have it mended, by any thing I could do, though it were the obeying of the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. for my Obedience is but the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of a ſtained Nature, that has already broken that righteous Law. When Guilt, Defilement and Weakneſs of a fooliſh, depraved heart, lies upon me as a lump of Lead, I get nothing by talking with it; as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the Fool, <hi>Anſwer not a fool accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his folly, leſt thou be like him,</hi> Prov. 26. 4. for this talking with Guilt and Weakneſs, draweth my Soul (which is made free indeed by the Son of God) to the likeneſs of that Guilt and Weakneſs, and my ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified Conſcience begins again to lick up the old Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Fear and Bondage; but my work is then to caſt my ſelf, by naked Reliance on Jeſus Chriſt, who juſtifieth the Ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with the Guard of God's free everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtification, in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt; and having the ſhelter of this Guard, then I may return, and plead with Guilt, and hear the complaints of my heart, and the accuſations of my Conſcience; and give them Anſwers, from the fulneſs of Chriſt's Atonement: and thus again the Fool (if ſuch a term may be uſed in this compariſon) is anſwered, <hi>leſt he ſhould be wiſe in his own conceit,</hi> Prov. 26. 5. I mean, that the Spirit of Bondage, which by the advantage of my own ſin, pleads rationally againſt my Peace, till Faith comes with the Tongue of the Learned, and pleads the Myſtery of Free Grace, againſt the Plea of Reaſon; and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and his Holineſs, againſt Sin and Guilt. Nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt <hi>Sampſon,</hi> till he betrayed the Vow of God that was upon him: ſo nothing can prevail
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109216:43"/> againſt the Peace of Juſtification, till Guilt divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul, and naked Reliance upon the perſonal Perfection of Chriſts Sacrifice and Mediatorſhip. The Soul that lays his Foundation thus, will not boaſt in himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. nor wrong the Viſits of God's favourable Countenance by Pride and Wantonneſs, nor yet deſpair when Storms ariſe; becauſe his foundation is upon a Rock, and his ſafety is not at all any of his own Handy-work. As far as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds this All-ſufficiency of Chriſt's Mediatorſhip, the eye affects the heart to ſecurity and ſtrength, and crumbles all Self-ſufficiency to powder, and blows away <hi>the Egyptian</hi> Locuſts of Guilt and Fears, into the Red Sea, and reſtores Pacification and Quiet to the Conſcience; and from this glorious Sanctuary, the Soul comes forth to do the Actions of a new Life, by the vertue of another Spirit, the Spirit of Love, and a ſound Mind; and worketh the Works of God in the World, and takes pleaſure in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth; and, if it were poſſible, it would actually keep the whole Law; in as much as being now eternally knit to Chriſt's Perſon by Faith, the Law, by the Spirit of Chriſt, is written in the heart.</p>
            <p>This naked Reliance on Chriſt's Perſon, was the great endeavour, and (left to us as) the experience of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>A Faith of which nature was exerciſed eminently by the holy Men of old; <hi>Abraham, Rom. 4. 20. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal. 71. 16. Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 2. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>There were two foundational Reaſons mentioned, why the Soul is wholly to caſt it ſelf on the naked perſonal Merit of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan our Righteouſneſs, and he only perfected the ſame for ever; and thoſe reaſons well weighed,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109216:44"/> have great ſtrength and motive-vertue in them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Faith; and beſides, 'tis commanded as the abſolute Condition of <hi>Salvation, Act. 16. 31. Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> in oppoſition to which, Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is made (in the diſpenſation of the Goſpel) the reaſon of dying under the guilt of ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. For the Goſpel doth ſo perfectly hold out Jeſus Chriſt to be the Propitiation for all the ſins of the World (through the value of his Death, and open freeneſs of the Tender thereof) that the very <hi>Hinge of Salvation</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> is turned upon the <hi>Faith</hi> of the heart therein, or <hi>Unbelief thereof,</hi> as being the moſt neceſſary and ſuitable Requiſites, for the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Soul into an actual condition of Life or Death eternally.</p>
            <p>Yea, Chriſt pronounceth forgiveneſs of ſins to the <hi>Palſie-man, Luk.</hi> 5. 20. upon the meer Account of Believing. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God to be upon all that believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any difference upon any other reſpect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. This one thing ſaved the Thief upon the Croſs, when he had not opportunity to make Satisfaction for all the Wrongs and Robberies he had done. This makes the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſo labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to preſerve this Myſtery from the leaſt mixture of Legal Righteouſneſs, <hi>Gal. 5. 2. Becauſe a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's State and Life is wholly by Grace,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>which entirely treats with the Faith of a Believer, and not with his Works of Righteouſneſs or Sin:</hi> the one cannot help, nor the other hinder; becauſe they are as the Elements of another World, as they are called, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 3. and can neither mend nor hurt that Juſtification by Jeſus Chriſt, revealed from Heaven to a Believer, no more than Earthly Food can feed a Spirit, or a material Sword wound an Angel. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109216:44"/> reaſon is, becauſe the Perſon of Chriſt is the Ark where Righteouſneſs and Pardon is kept, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſingly, by the Spirit of Grace, to Faith (which is the Acceptance of the ſame) and ſo it is ſure from any <hi>perſonal qualifications</hi> on Man's part to hinder it, where 'tis by the Spirit of Believing accepted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Juſtification</hi> of a ſinner by <hi>Faith</hi> in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, is that which lays a firm ground for <hi>Aſſurance of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance;</hi> becauſe the guilt of ſin is done away, and pardoned, at the firſt believing on Jeſus Chriſt: and if they be then done away, their guilt cannot really return; for the pardon of ſins, and remembring them no more are joyned together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ſins committed after the Souls Converſion to God, by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, hazard the final ſtate of ſuch an one; becauſe his perſon was made accepted at the firſt cloſing with Chriſt by Faith; and Pardon of ſins is but the Conſequent of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of his Perſon, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 6. Rev.</hi> 1. 5. So that Chriſt having eſpouſed a ſinner to himſelf by Faith, doth waſh him from his filth, and preſents him to himſelf at length without Spot, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. and the perſon being recieved upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of meer Grace, ſin has no equal Plea againſt ſuch an one, becauſe the ſtrength of his Plea muſt be by the Law; and Grace having ſupplanted the Accuſation of the Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 17. the Trial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in another Court, where ſin is caſt out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. And if ſin could not at firſt hinder the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the perſon, much leſs can it procure a Diſ-acceptation afterwards, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the perſon of every Convert is conſidered (in his true Intereſt through Grace) in the Perſon of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109216:45"/> Jeſus Chriſt, in whom all Accuſations are fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> having got this Foundation, Encouragment, and Rightful Intereſt in the Remiſſion of Sins, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Life and Peace, ſets it ſelf by Spiritual Exerciſe, to put the Soul into ſure and quiet Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof, in a through and direct levelling its eye at the <hi>Object, the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and to that end, it gets the Soul up above the Reaſonings of the Old Man, Fleſh and Blood, into the Mount of Goſpel-reaſon; and from thence, through the Promiſes, and demonſtration of the Word of Truth by the Spirit, (as through a Proſpective-Glaſs) ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into its eye the lovely view of a compleat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and gazeth upon him, till a Dart ſtrike through the Liver, and the Soul be made like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab,</hi> and is both willingly and ſafely carried into a holy confidence of the truth of what it ſeeth; and the truth of its own, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the free and liberal reach of the deſign of God's Free Mercy, in a way of particular Application thereof, and cryeth out, <hi>My Lord,</hi> and <hi>my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And O, that my Soul were a little upon the wings of the Spirit, to aſcend by Faith into this Mount of God, my Saviour.</p>
            <p>Why abide I among the Folds of corrupt Nature to hear the bleating of my own Confuſions and Luſts ſeeing the Sword of the Lord and his <hi>Gideon</hi> is drawn for my deliverance?

            <p>In this glorious Work, Faith ſeizeth on the Soul, as the Angel did ſeize upon <hi>Lot,</hi> and (as it were) tear him out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> with this bleſſed advantage; that it makes the Soul willing, in the day of God's Power, to be pulled with violence out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> out of all its fleſhly filth, and fleſhly ſtate: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth to ſee the Blood of former Luſts to be ſprinkled on all its Raiment: 'Tis <hi>wrathful</hi> againſt the <hi>Inchantments of Self-Pride, Man's Applauſe, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon, Earthly Compliances, Fleſhly Fears and Diſtruſt:</hi> It roars againſt its Senſual Mind, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſultations, as a Lyon over its Prey. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hingeth the Gates of its Captivity, and carrieth them up to the top of the Mount, never to return again. Mighty is this <hi>Sampſon</hi>-Faith, when its Locks of ſanctified Convictions, and Manifeſtation of Grace, are grown up to ſome happy maturity, it looks fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further after Chriſt in every Scripture, it rejoyceth exceedingly to find the free Gift of Chriſt in ſuch Language as this; <hi>I will give thee for a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the people, that thou mayeſt ſay to the priſoners, Go forth,</hi> Iſa. 49. 8, 9. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy ſins for my own ſake,</hi> Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>and will not remember them any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the poor Soul looks down upon the ſcars of its own vile heart, and daily weakneſſes, and cries out; Oh! but what are theſe Wounds in my heart and hands, theſe thorns in my ſides, theſe pricks in my eyes?</p>
            <p>The Underſtanding (triumphing through Faith) replies; Theſe are the Memorials of the Wounds with which Chriſt was wounded in the Houſe of his Friends, when he came to his own, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109216:46"/> him not; and when the Sword of Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion awoke againſt the Shepherd, one who account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no Robbery to be equal with God; he then ſaved the Sheep, and after a ſore Conflict, ſlew the Wolf, and gathered again the Poor of the Flock, who were appointed (by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>) to the Slaughter. Ariſe therefore, and be not diſmayed at the Witneſſes of Chriſt's Agony, which dwells (for a ſeaſon) in thy mortal Fleſh. The Battel was his, not thine: he mortally wounded the Dragon, and the God of Peace will ſhortly tread down Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and every Spawn of his under your feet. Theſe Enemies are left to prove your <hi>Faith, Integrity</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> that you might learn Spiritual War, and be renowned by Victory, through the mighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Captain of your Salvation.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Faith</hi> fixeth its eye again upon Jeſus Chriſt through the Word, and beholds him as a Lamb that was ſlain, and yet riſen; and there ſees the Grave, where the guilt of Conſcience was buried, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth it ſelf into Freedom. Guilt is deſtroyed, and none can raiſe the Dead but God only: but God will not raiſe it up, becauſe he deſtroyed it himſelf, that he might marry the Juſtified Soul to himſelf, out of that Deſtruction of Guilt and Bondage, in the Perſon of his own Son, that he might thereby bring forth Life and Immortality to ſinners, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 10. Rom.</hi> 5. 6. by Faith; and therefore here Faith ſtrives to keep its eye, while hands and feet are working; and by this Compaſs it ſteers its Courſe, towards the Haven of Safety.</p>
            <p>But the abundant Grace, and vaſtneſs of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in and through the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, is ſo great, that my eye is dazled; I am not able to meaſure the Heavens; I bring my Bucket to hold
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109216:46"/> the Sea, and 'tis drowned in the great Waters. And yet here Faith has a Refuge againſt Confuſion of Mind; <hi>viz.</hi> when it eſpies a <hi>paſſive ſence</hi> in all the Juſtification and Acceptation of the Goſpel, and in all the Fruits thereof; working me up to, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me to be content with a Conformity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Meaſure given me by Jeſus Chriſt. Hence are the words diſcovering it rendred in a paſſive ſenſe, <hi>Juſtified, Redeemed,</hi> and <hi>Saved:</hi> and the Action of this is aſcribed only to Chriſt, or God in Chriſt; who <hi>juſtifieth, redeemeth</hi> and <hi>ſaveth.</hi> And hence alſo Faith giveth the Soul Relief againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Mind, about defect of knowledge, by the thought of this; that though I know little, yet I am known perfectly of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9. and though I apprehend little of the great Myſtery of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet I am apprehended fully by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. while I receive him by Faith, and am willing to be comprehended, and moulded by his Spirit. It was but a ſmall thing (on Mans part) to touch the Hem of Chriſt's Garment; yet that being an Act of Reliance on Chriſt, and ſubjecting the Soul to him, preſently there came in, Health of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Pardon of Sins, from that comprehending Relation in which Chriſt ſtood to ſuch a Soul. The Souls work in Faith (or rather, that to which the Soul is wrought) is a contentedneſs to receive the Perſon of Chriſt by Faith, as the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of its Intereſt, in more than it can be ever able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive within its own capacity.</p>
            <p>The Soul that receives the Perſon of Chriſt, by one true cloſing hint, through Faith, receives a rightful Propriety to every Excellency and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction that is in God, laid up in Chriſt for that end, though the length of that Perfection and Bleſſing be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109216:47"/> never fully known. As a Man who buyes a Field (if no Exception in the Laws of that Nation be made) he buyes all the Advantages of that piece of Earth, downwards, to the very Centre of the Earth, and all between that and the Stars, albeit he really minds no more (it may be) than the <hi>Graſſie Superficies</hi> of his Land, till he diſcovers ſome other Excellency; <hi>Then</hi> he minds that alſo, and owns it, whether it be Mines of Gold or Silver, or whatever is in the nature of the Earth, which was not known when he bought it; becauſe he bought a Right to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſtriction, to any particular quality in it: So is it with a Soul, that by Faith lays hold on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt's Perſon: it may be, his eye is chiefly on freedom from the guilt of ſin; but in taking the Perſon of Chriſt, he recieves not only Pardon, but a true Right to whatſoever is in Chriſt, relating to this Life, and that which is to come; the Heaven of Heavens is not able to contain the utmoſt of that Inheritance which belongs to a Believer, becauſe it cannot contain God. This Faith diſcovers, and cries out, <hi>My lines are fallen in a fruitful place, I have a goodly heritage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith being thus mounted, it has<note place="margin">The Influence of Faith into new O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> many advantages (for 'tis skilful, and therefore victorious:) It has the advantage of diſcovery, for offence or defence: It has Champion Ground, and a clear Air to breath in; and ſo is every way furniſhed for Victory and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>And as Faith is thus fitted by means of its ſtation and capacity for diſcovery, ſo it lies under the Bond of Obedience, engaged and commanded to accept and drink in the Happineſs that lies in Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:109216:47"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith is eminently both Privilege and Duty:</hi> A Privilege, in that it enters on the Poſſeſſion of the whole Covenant of Grace, and Eternal Life here upon the Earth; and 'tis bound thereto in point of Duty.</p>
            <p>The Nature of Duty and Obedience is the better diſcerned, if we conſider the nature of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Commandment may be thus underſtood, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Primitive,</hi> or <hi>Superadded. Primitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> are ſuch as conſtitute the Pale between Good and Evil; and are the Demonſtrations of Righteouſneſs, the contrary to which is Sin and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, which was originally given to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man in Paradiſe; and after the Fall, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Tables of Stone; to which that relates which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>Where there is no law there is no tranſgreſſion, for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4. This <hi>Law</hi> was revived by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for diſcovery and conviction of Sin and Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gal. 3. 19. Rom.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Superadded Commandments</hi> are all Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and enforcing Precepts in the Scripture, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Obedience to the primitive Rules of God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Will, which are (as it were) the Emblem of his righteous Nature, manifeſted to Man. And theſe two have a different manner of Obligement; The <hi>primitive</hi> Commandments do oblige from the very Nature of God, and diſcovery of his Will, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the defilement of Man by his Apoſtacy. And theſe do ſhew what is the duty which Man ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his Creator.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſuperadded</hi> Precepts, by way of Exhortation, or by way of Commanding Charge, do ſeem rather to oblige, from the apparent Equity of the Will of God manifeſted, to ſhew his moſt holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109216:48"/> Nature by; and ſerveth to apply the heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The breach of the former is Tranſgreſſion, the breach of the latter is actual (though impotent) Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and (methinks) is properly that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led diſobedience. Albeit all ſin is truly termed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, yet this ſeems to have a foul tincture of a repugnant Will, in diſobeying; and ſo oft as the Command is renewed, this diſobedience is the more aggravated and increaſed.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Draft</hi> and <hi>Model</hi> ſerves to diſcover what is Obedience, or Diſobedience in the new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>new World</hi> (as it were) of <hi>Salvation</hi> by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the manifeſtation of Free Grace, in the Doctrine of Chriſt's <hi>Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion, &amp;c.</hi> doth make the Treaty between the ſpotleſs <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of Chriſt's moſt <hi>holy Nature,</hi> and the <hi>natural Guilt</hi> and lump of Wretchedneſs, that has over-ſpread the Nature and Life of ſinful Man; which Manifeſtation of Chriſt preſents it ſelf, in a way of Cure, to defiled Man; and doth (in a primitive way, <hi>viz.</hi> in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it) require defiled Man to be Healed. There is vertually, in the very manifeſtation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, a Command gone forth to loſt Man to return, and accept the Salvation that is thus provided and held forth: Beſides which, there comes in the next place, <hi>a poſitive Command to believe, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 23. with many invitations, perſuaſions and directions about it. The not receiving the former is blindneſs, the not receiving the latter is (more eminently) wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful blindneſs; and both of them wretched impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, becauſe the Letter of the Goſpel it ſelf cannot quicken. The Spirit of this Goſpel doth therefore go further, in behalf of the Elect, who were pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109216:48"/> given to Chriſt; and preſents it ſelf as a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power in all the parts of it, and as the real ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and moſt effectual Remedy againſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Guilt: which alſo is, in the next place, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a Law (in the hand of the Spirit) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it by Faith; and this is that quickning vertue, in all invitations and perſuaſions to receive and apply that glorious Remedy. And this is that <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Law</hi> which every Convert lies under; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Manifeſtation it ſelf, and a ſpiritual requiring Word,</hi> commanding the Conſcience to receive it, and live thereby, through an actually exerciſed Faith. For, as God purſued Man's Apoſtacy and diſobedience, through <hi>Adam,</hi> to death and deſtruction, ſo he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth Man's Remedy, through the Death and Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to Juſtification of Life and Salvation. In the former, God ſaid, Man muſt die; in the latter he ſaith, Man muſt and ſhall live: <hi>He himſelf is the Commander, and the life and ſtrength of his own Commands;</hi> in that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is not only <hi>a living Soul</hi> (as the firſt was) but <hi>a quickning Spirit, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 45.</p>
            <p>This Command from God in the Goſpel, to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, receive,</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> Pardon and Righteouſneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Act. 13. 38, 39. c. 16. 31. 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 23. even that Righteouſneſs and Salvation which is laid up in the Perſon of the Mediator, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9, 10. for every one who comes for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and would enjoy the ſame, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (I ſay) neceſſarily requires Obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>Rom. 16. 26. This Obedience is exerciſed in a pure and free receiving Jeſus Chriſt as my only Redeemer;</hi> as being bought by him, and being made his. I am not my own, I muſt not meaſure my ſelf by my ſelf, but by what he is for me, and to me. When the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109216:49"/> temptations of <hi>Fear,</hi> through my perſonal Guilt, do command me to <hi>Deſpair,</hi> I muſt not obey them, but muſt obey the Law of Chriſt, the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> (as 'tis called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22.) when <hi>Pride</hi> of heart, or <hi>Self-ability</hi> doth command me to boaſt, I muſt not obey it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. but muſt reply, <hi>I am not under the Law</hi> of my own Sin, nor of my own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. but <hi>I am under the Law of my own Lord;</hi> which is to receive him, and own his Righteouſneſs as my own; for he is <hi>the Lord my Righteouſneſs. When I believe, then I obey;</hi> for I am commanded to believe in the Name of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God; when I caſt my ſelf on him that fulfilled the whole Law, then I fulfil the whole Law; when I caſt my ſelf on his Righteouſneſs, I am (in God's ſight) as white as Snow; my ſins (in this new ſtate) are rather accounted my diſeaſes, than my faults: for if I am not my own, my ſins are not my own; but accounted his, <hi>who loved me, and waſhed me in his Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Obedience of Faith</hi> has the ſight of Chriſt's Fulneſs, and the Promiſes of the new Covenant to lean upon; and ſo it takes its Journy, <hi>from Fleſh to Spirit, from Weakneſs to Strength,</hi> in the Name of the Lord. And from this Obedience in believing, (which is the higheſt and myſterious Obedience) proceeds all manner of holineſs, as the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which receive their Sap from this Root: this Root makes them to be living Obedience, as Branches from the ſame Root, Children of the ſame Parent. The firſt Subjection is, to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt's Perſon, to ſubmit all Fear and Guilt, to the fulneſs of Pardon and Life that is in him, as the Store-houſe, and there to enjoy it in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; and then, by the Spirit of Life which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109216:49"/> is in Chriſt, the Soul with freedom acts forth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably, in ſome meaſure, to ſuch a renewed ſtate, from whence all Actions of Holineſs are called the Fruits of Faith, and Fruits of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil. 1. 11. 2 Cor. 9. 10. Col. 1. 6. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>After my Return from—<note place="margin">One of Faiths dark days, and yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> I found ſore Breaches made upon my Soul; my inward Man had ſuffered loſs, while I travelled up and down, my Soul was violently ſhaken; the Bands of the wicked one conſpired with my wicked heart, and carried away my treacherous Soul; ſo that my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was captivated into the Enemies hand. A Wind from the Wilderneſs laid me in confuſion; the Tempeſt prevailed, and I ſuffered Shipwreck; all my own feeble Endeavours, and former Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations gave way, and the raging Sea of filthy and fooliſh thoughts did beat ſore upon me: My Ship (of former Reſolutions of heart, and my poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Salvation of God) was bulged, and ready to ſink; yet my heart yerned after the Lord, my Rock. I cried ſecretly (though confuſedly) to my God, and he yet reſerved a Plank for my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt drowned Soul to ſwim to the Shoar. He has not utterly removed Mercy from me; he has been yet preaching his own Free Grace to my Soul, through a Voice of Thunder and Lightning. Let me yet hear thy Voice, O thou Preſerver of Men; let me yet gather up advantage through my loſs; help me yet to receive recovering and eſtabliſhing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from my ſtrong Hold. While my thoughts were thus working, I endeavoured to get once more into the Sanctuary of God; and there I found, that although I carry about a <hi>Hell</hi> within me, yet that Hell cannot devour the infinite <hi>Covenant of Peace,</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:109216:50"/> which God made. My Unbelief and Diſobedience cannot make the Faith of God to be of no effect.</p>
            <p>I would have lived upon Grace and Strength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved, and I trembled to ſee thoſe ſelfiſh Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences ſhaken to the Earth; but now (methinks) Chriſt calls me again from my Father's Houſe, and promiſeth me a better Name, than that of Sons and Daughters of my own, a Name in himſelf, an Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring in himſelf, <hi>Pſal. 45. 16. Iſa.</hi> 56. 5. which ſhall not be cut off. I have had a Sentence of Death in my ſelf, that I might not truſt any more in my ſelf, but in God who raiſed the Dead. I am a <hi>dry Tree;</hi> but <hi>he</hi> who was raiſed from the Dead, is <hi>a green Tree,</hi> and <hi>in him is my Fruit found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the <hi>Myſtery</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of this <hi>Salvation</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am ſaved! O that I might paſs (as it were) through the Eye of a Needle, into Chriſt's Power, and there reſt from the days of adverſity. And this Reſt is glorious, becauſe 'tis uncompounded, it receives no Ingredients from abroad; 'tis ſingly made up of Chriſt; and in him alone. Venture, O my Soul, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>naked Arm,</hi> for 'tis an Arm of <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> This Strength alone is a Fountain of Strength; this is the <hi>River</hi> whoſe <hi>Streams make glad</hi> the <hi>City of God.</hi> Wilt thou not be <hi>undone,</hi> O my Soul! that thou mayeſt be <hi>ſaved?</hi> How long wilt thou ſet up thy <hi>Poſt</hi> by the <hi>Pillars</hi> of that <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> which is wrought in God for thee, and wrought in thee by ſingle Union with God in Jeſus Chriſt? Is not his Arm ſtronger than thine? Be thou <hi>tranſlated</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> into <hi>Divine Strength.</hi> Let not thy Wine be mixed with Water. Thy Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are rejected, make a <hi>Voyage</hi> to the <hi>everlaſting Hills,</hi> enter into the <hi>Mount of God.</hi> Thou haſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both the Tables of the Covenant, and yet the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109216:50"/> 
               <hi>Prince</hi> of the ſame <hi>Covenant</hi> lives. Wait for the Spirit to draw it over again and again, by the <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Character</hi> of his own Finger, who lives to enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee for ever.</p>
            <p>How hard is it to depart from Self, from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Self, and ſinful Self: I am wounded by ſinful Self, that I might flee from righteous Self, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Self alſo, and <hi>caſt Anchor</hi> only <hi>within the Vale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am weary of the inſtability of the <hi>Streams;</hi> Oh let me go to the <hi>Fountain.</hi> When I am ſaying I ſhall die in my Neſt, my Neſt is ſoon fired about my ears, and turned to aſhes. Certainly there is a better Reſt than this, and it lieth in truſting Chriſt, and truſting in him only: I both truſt Chriſt, and truſt in Chriſt, when I believe that he is the <hi>Standard</hi> of all <hi>ſaving Righteouſneſs</hi> communicable to Man; and all my <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> is but the <hi>Reflection</hi> of his. I truſt in Chriſt, when I live reſignedly at his Feet, to be made holy. And whatſoever compoſure of heart I do at any time receive, I do not, nor cannot hold it; but 'tis held by him while it remains: and when it withdraws, it lives in the <hi>Root</hi> for me. I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think, if I had all Graces in my own diſpoſe, I would manage them to the Glory of God; but how can God be glorified more, than in a holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to live at his Allowance? All his deſign is to allure me, and ſo to <hi>force</hi> me <hi>out of my ſelf, to live in him,</hi> as well as to live <hi>by him:</hi> he beſtows his Grace within doors. I muſt not take his Graces to my ſelf, to put it to Uſury for Increaſe; but muſt fetch the <hi>Increaſe,</hi> as well as the <hi>Principal</hi> from him, by Union with him through Jeſus Chriſt: and my work is to reſt on his Faithfulneſs, Wiſdom, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and Readineſs to ſupply me; as if every Grace of the Spirit were fully in my own manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109216:51"/> and power to exerciſe the ſame. This is the true Life of Faith; this is the way of <hi>walking up and down</hi> in the <hi>Name of the Lord.</hi> When I actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge every Meaſure of Spiritual Strength to hold its <hi>Tenure</hi> from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſingly</hi> and <hi>wholly,</hi> and reſt confidently upon him for it; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath promiſed both Grace, Glory, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing; judging him faithful who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and owning him thereon for my Inheritance, and my ſelf nothing but what he is for me: Then I may be ſaid to truſt Jeſus Chriſt, and to truſt in him only. I truſt him upon his Word to be All for me, which I would ſpiritually be; and I truſt in him to enjoy the ſame, through the Faith of my Intereſt in him, and his abounding <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Unction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This cuts the heart of <hi>Self-Pride, ſpiritual Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Slothfulneſs,</hi> when I live every moment at the mercy of another, even Jeſus Chriſt, both for Juſtifying Righteouſneſs, and every Influence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the immediate Breathings of his Spirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his good pleaſure; having not the power, ſo much as to make one Hair white or black: but I muſt <hi>wholly work</hi> by his <hi>Hands, ſee</hi> by his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and in his <hi>Light behold</hi> the <hi>Light.</hi> What more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inducement can there be to Self-denial than this? Boaſting is excluded, becauſe Chriſt, in his own <hi>Perſon,</hi> and by his own <hi>Spirit,</hi> doth whatſoever is done for me, or in me. Here lies the Myſtery and Labour of Faith, which the meer Notion thereof can never reach unto, ſo as to improve the ſame to a <hi>ſelf-denying Activity</hi> for God, in the paths of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Travel towards <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is in our dear Lord Jeſus<note place="margin">Chriſt ſpiritually, not perſonally communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Believers.</note> a two-fold Excellency to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, as he is their Portion;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109216:51"/> His <hi>Eſſential Power, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in the <hi>Godhead;</hi> and his <hi>proper Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perſonally united</hi> thereunto, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. and neither of theſe (conſidered as ſuch) can be communicated unto the Children of Men; his Perſon cannot be divided, imparted or broken. And there is <hi>another Excellency flowing from the former,</hi> by way of <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>inward Vertue, communicated</hi> to the hearts of the Redeemed, by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which formeth, reneweth and quickneth the New Man, the new Creature in the Soul.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, though it cannot (in a ſtrict ſenſe) be <hi>communicated,</hi> yet it is wholly <hi>by Covenant given</hi> to the Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 8. So that God, in his vaſt Eſſential Infiniteneſs, is their God; and his ve-Body that was dead, and is now alive, was alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. and is become theirs by Covenant, and they enjoy it in that Right, though it remains <hi>perſonally</hi> to be his own (and not theirs, but) for them to all Eternity; the Excellency of which God and Man, in the Perfection of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is ſo far reckoned and imputed theirs by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Union,</hi> and <hi>Myſtical Ingrafture,</hi> as may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deliver them from all Evil, and fill them with all Righteouſneſs, Purity and Perfection which Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-capacity can take in for the enjoying of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. So that the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Mediator</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the <hi>perſons</hi> of the <hi>Redeemed,</hi> and are not <hi>mixed,</hi> but <hi>united</hi> through the Spirit, in the Covenant, and his Perſonal Aſſumption of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, by Faith exerciſed therein.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the <hi>Intereſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Advantages of Chriſt's being without us perſonally, and yet ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in us who believe.</note> which the Saints have in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>enjoyable</hi> by them <hi>ſingly, through believing:</hi> which Enjoyment,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109216:52"/> through the ſpiritual Nature of the Union, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſtrong and ſure as whatſoever they enjoy in their own perſons, by ſenſe and feeling, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 17. Rom.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>And thus Chriſt, as to the Perfection of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being without us, and above us; and yet by the Communication of the Spirit, through Faith, made near to us, and dwelling in us, yields much privilege, and unſpeakable advantage to a Believer, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Excellency of a Believer's Portion in Chriſt is hereby more <hi>diſtinctly viewed,</hi> the Soul has here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by room to go round about the <hi>unſpotted Luſtre</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and <hi>View</hi> him from <hi>head</hi> to <hi>foot,</hi> as the Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> doth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. as the <hi>choiceſt of ten thouſands;</hi> whereas the Glory of the ſame Chriſt, as far as it appears only in the heart by Operation, is much dimmed and ſullyed with the defilement that is there, and continual Conflicts; but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſeperated far away from ſin and ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. furniſhed with utmoſt Perfection and cloathed with Garments of compleat Victory and Beauty in the behalf of his Redeemed. This fills their hearts with joy, and their mouths with ſinging.</p>
            <p>2. He is thereby become alſo the <hi>livelier Object</hi> of their <hi>Love;</hi> for the eye affects the heart, and nouriſheth ſpiritual Enflamedneſs towards him: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance 'twixt the Soul and ſo excellent an Object (I ſay) <hi>diſtance</hi> of this ſort between the <hi>Eye</hi> and its <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> through <hi>Propriety</hi> in him, <hi>enamours</hi> the <hi>Mind;</hi> and withall, it <hi>provokes deſire</hi> towards him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 11. and makes the Soul of a Believer cry out for more nearneſs. <hi>Come, O my Beloved;</hi> this deſire quickens expectation to rejoyce in hope, and leaves no room for a loathing, weariſome Fulneſs in the heart.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:109216:52"/>
            <p>3. This <hi>objective enjoyment</hi> of Chriſt gives <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for a <hi>kindly refuge</hi> in him; it rationally leads the inward Man to depart from all <hi>other ſelfs,</hi> and run to this <hi>objective ſelf, Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, through the <hi>drawing vertue</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual Union</hi> with him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. and thus was Chriſt typed out by the <hi>Cities of Refuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This Enjoyment of Chriſt by way of Object is alſo a <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Recovery</hi> when the Soul is <hi>foiled;</hi> it can fetch <hi>freſh righteouſneſs, freſh pardon,</hi> and be <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> again and again with <hi>freſh Oyl, Pſal.</hi> 92. 10. as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, and ſeventy ſeven times a day; yea, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as oft as the heart pants after him.</p>
            <p>5. 'Tis alſo a <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Eaſe,</hi> by pouring out a Complaint into his <hi>boſom:</hi> 'Tis great refreſhment to have a <hi>Friend,</hi> to whom one may declare ones <hi>miſery,</hi> were it only to receive <hi>pity</hi> from his hands, <hi>Job</hi> 16. 14. but in Chriſt, looked upon by Faith, there is a <hi>power</hi> as well as <hi>pity</hi> to help, be the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Burden what it will be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. and how great ſoever.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis a Fountain alſo of <hi>Confidence:</hi> and hence doth the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> in the name of the people of God, argue againſt the Triumph of the Enemy, <hi>Mic. 7. 7, 8. I will look unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rejoyce not over me, O my enemy; though I fall, I ſhall riſe again.</hi> And Chriſt himſelf doth teach his people Confidence by his own Example in the day of his ſuffering, <hi>Iſa. 50. 8. Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. in that his Father was near to juſtifie him.</p>
            <p>7. Chriſt thus taken up, <hi>helps</hi> againſt the <hi>ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of our <hi>Journey</hi> towards <hi>Heaven;</hi> a <hi>Believer</hi> has a <hi>friend</hi> to <hi>talk</hi> with by the <hi>way,</hi> who is a <hi>Guide</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and therefore great is the loſs of that man, who walks alone, and compaſſeth himſelf about with his own <hi>ſparks; if he fall</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>he has none
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109216:53"/> to raiſe him up again,</hi> Eccleſ. 4. 10. and thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is held forth as a comfortable <hi>Leader</hi> and <hi>Companion, Iſa. 57. 18. Jer.</hi> 3. 14. And the Church improves this Privilege, <hi>by leaning on her Beloved,</hi> as ſhe comes forth out of the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> This bleſſed Companion makes way for his peoples <hi>ſafety,</hi> in the <hi>Fire,</hi> and in the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Affliction, Dan. 3. 25. Iſa.</hi> 43. 2.</p>
            <p>8. And by this means alſo Faith has got a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful Witneſs</hi> on the Believers ſide, to clear off Accuſations; and from hence are thoſe expreſſions uſed in the <hi>Pſalms, Plead my cauſe, Be ſurety for me, &amp;c.</hi> and the often <hi>Appeals</hi> made to God, who trieth the Heart and Reins, and who <hi>ſtandeth up on the ſide of his people,</hi> and on their <hi>behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and infinitely more <hi>Privileges</hi> do ariſe to every Believer, from the Intereſt that he hath in Chriſt's entire and incommunicable Perſon, by the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Free Govenant</hi> and <hi>Myſtical Ingrafture,</hi> and the <hi>Communion</hi> of Vertue derived from the Perſon of this <hi>Mediator;</hi> in which Myſtery of Grace he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys Chriſt as the <hi>Hand</hi> enjoys the <hi>Head,</hi> yet both of them are <hi>diſtinctly</hi> conſidered in the Body: or as the <hi>Eye</hi> enjoys the influence and vertue of that very <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> which is in the very <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> although the body of the Sun be many <hi>thouſand Miles</hi> diſtant from that Eye which doth actually enjoy that Sun in the light and heat of its influence; and doth as truly enjoy it, as if it lay in the material Body of the Sun, and in a way of greater advantage, fitted for its capacity and uſe. So is the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> enjoyed really and truly with all Privileges relating to Believers, whiles he retains his <hi>Perſonality uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated</hi> and <hi>undivided</hi> to any other; as the very <hi>Water</hi> of the <hi>Fountain</hi> is enjoyed in the <hi>Streams,</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109216:53"/> the <hi>Sap</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> enjoyed in the <hi>Branches;</hi> and yet the <hi>Stream</hi> is not the <hi>Fountain,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Branches</hi> any part of the <hi>Root.</hi>

            <p>The way of the Souls enjoyment<note place="margin">Chriſt's Entrance upon the heart works Renewing there.</note> of Chriſt in all the <hi>Privileges</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of his <hi>Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and in all the <hi>Influences</hi> of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Unction</hi> and <hi>Transformation</hi> of the heart, into the power and likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, is wrought by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Regeneration</hi> through Faith; which cauſeth the Soul to <hi>paſs over</hi> from its <hi>ſelf,</hi> from all its <hi>ſtrength,</hi> from all its own <hi>carnal hope, fear</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh care, into</hi> the <hi>Death, Life, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo is enabled to ſay in truth, <hi>I am not mine own: I live; yet no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, viz.</hi> by the very Life, and in the very Life of Chriſt, <hi>apprehended, received, enjoyed,</hi> and <hi>working effectually</hi> in me, by Faith in him <hi>who loved me, and waſhed me from my ſins in his own blood,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Rev. 1. 5.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>tranſlating, renewing, changing</hi> and <hi>quickning</hi> work which the Scripture doth ſo often mention as the deſign of the Goſpel. And 'tis with reference unto this that Chriſt is called a <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>Stumbling,</hi> and <hi>Rock of Offence:</hi> ſinful and ſelfiſh Nature ſtrives to preſerve its life againſt the <hi>killing vertue</hi> of the Spirit of Chriſt in the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World. This is the reaſon of ſo much Carnal Profeſſion and Barrenneſs in Chriſtianity, when the hearts of Men turn the nature of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (which is a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> and obeyed only by Faith) into the ſimilitude of the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> and make it a matter of Man's working, and ſubject it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109216:54"/> to the poor and lame endeavours of unrenewed Man; not remembring, or (at leaſt) not underſtanding that the Tree muſt firſt be made good, before the Fruits can be good. This was meant by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when he bewails the Jews; who, though they <hi>followed</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Righteouſneſs, attained it not, becauſe they ſought it not by faith,</hi> but (as it were) by the <hi>works of the law,</hi> Rom. 9. 31, 32. Ever ſince the Fall of Man, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs forſook the created Nature of Man; which is largely ſhewed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 10. and is only now in Chriſt revealed from Heaven, in receiving of whom, by being <hi>baptiſed ſpiritually</hi> into his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> his Righteouſneſs is enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Every Command of the Goſpel doth firſt require Faith, which is the great Commandment, and in the vertue and power thereof requires and works Holineſs in all the Fruits of a new Life, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Jeſus Chriſt, working in every Precept and Command of God in the whole <hi>Scriptures,</hi> being <hi>Goſpellized</hi> by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>And here my heart begins again to groan, while I find ſo little of this <hi>killing, renewing power</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing its work upon me. How far am I from this renewed State? I am weary of the <hi>lifeleſs Notion</hi> of the thing. I faint in my ſighing, and find no reſt. I long for the breath of the Lord, and lament out my Complaint before him. When will the Lord come into his Temple? My fleſh trembleth 'twixt <hi>hope, fear</hi> and <hi>deſire:</hi> I am as a Bottle dried in the Smoak, my heart is pained and in Travel. <hi>O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of Men make no tarrying, leſt I be like them who go down to the pit.</hi> Oh, let Death feed upon me, till the Foundation of <hi>Life, Power</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> be laid in my Soul, and Deliverance come from another place. Droopings are deadly (O my Soul!) do not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109216:54"/> ſay, thy Wound is incurable; the <hi>Creator</hi> of <hi>the ends</hi> of <hi>the Earth</hi> doth <hi>undertake</hi> for thee; he will yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal abundance of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> Come then, <hi>O Fountain of Help!</hi> and do thine own Will upon me.</p>
            <p>How eaſie is it to ſay the word (<hi>Renewing</hi>) in compariſon of the thing really executed and done?</p>
            <p>All that can be ſpoken about it is but words; the Change it ſelf is the thing I long for: my eyes fail, with hoping for the very Salvation of God in this work. Oh, that the Heavens might drop down their Dew! Why are the Influences of the Clouds with-held? Oh, for the ſounding of his Bowels who is gone into a far Country, and has promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn! My <hi>muſing</hi> heart cannot fetch him, but my <hi>groaning</hi> is before him, and the <hi>tears</hi> and <hi>cries</hi> of my Soul is in his ſight. O Earth, cover thou not my blood! let the cry of my diſtreſs be heard: <hi>Anguiſh</hi> is upon my heart, and Oh, let the Seaſon of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption come!</p>
            <p>According to the meaſure of the power of Chriſt given to me, I would yet ſtruggle againſt this Gyant (<hi>unmortified ſelf:</hi>) I would rather take a <hi>Sling</hi> and a <hi>Stone</hi> in the power of Chriſt, than all the <hi>Weapons</hi> of a <hi>Carnal Arm</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt well knew the length of that <hi>Petition, Thy Will be done,</hi> when he taught his Diſciples that Prayer. Could I but pray this Prayer, in the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of it, I ſhould think my foot within the <hi>threſhold</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main <hi>Goſpel-killing work</hi> lies<note place="margin">The bleſſedneſs of a mortified <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Will.</note> in mortifying the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>Will,</hi> into the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the Spirit: and in regard my preſent Controverſie is againſt my
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109216:55"/> own <hi>Carnal Will,</hi> I would deal with that firſt, did not my <hi>unmortified Underſtanding</hi> ſtand in the way.</p>
            <p>My <hi>unmortified Underſtanding</hi> can eaſily <hi>dally</hi> with all the <hi>Notions</hi> about the <hi>Trinity, Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel, Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Covenant, Faith,</hi> and every <hi>Grace</hi> of the Spirit, and every <hi>Duty</hi> of Godlineſs, and yet but <hi>trifle</hi> all the while. The renewed Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucks in the lively Evidence of the Mind of God in all thoſe things, and is called the <hi>Demonſtration of Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 4. and the very <hi>Mind of Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 16. This Mind of Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to Faith, the infinite God wrapped up in every Particle of his Word, and is the Spirit of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry revealed Truth. Hence comes that Expreſſion, <hi>You have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 20. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Underſtanding is not taught by Words and Sentences, be they what they will, and though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good; but by the Mind of God and Chriſt in them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 21. The whole Volumne of the Scriptures is but (as it were) a ſmall hint of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable Will of God. And this is the reaſon why the Scriptures, though the words are the ſame, and not altered, yet do they, by the Spirit, ſpeak variety of Inſtructions in the Unity of the ſame Truth, as the Spirit pleaſeth to reveal it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; which doth not at all argue <hi>defect</hi> in the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> but <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> in the <hi>Mind of Chriſt</hi> therein contained.</p>
            <p>This Fulneſs of the Mind of Chriſt in the Word is that which makes it <hi>divide between the Soul and the Spirit, the Joynts and the Marrow;</hi> and is a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 12.</p>
            <p>A renewed Underſtanding makes uſe of the Word, and all the Expreſſions therein, but as the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109216:55"/> 
               <hi>Door</hi> by which to enter into the <hi>whole Viſion</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Revelation of his Will; and ſo takes up the Truth truly, in the <hi>method</hi> in which the infinite God is pleaſed to condeſcend.</p>
            <p>A renewed Underſtanding ſees the Myſtery of Truth to be <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> through that report of it which words do ſpeak. It <hi>converſeth with Life</hi> through the <hi>Conduit</hi> of <hi>Words, Phraſes</hi> and <hi>Terms:</hi> It gives way to the <hi>Truth, as it is in Jeſus,</hi> by <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and not mangle it with carnal Reaſon; and ſo makes way for the renewed Will to give Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by believing, doing and ſuffering the Pleaſure and Will of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>renewed Will</hi> is one with <hi>God's Will,</hi> in a way of Submiſſion thereto. It lies down <hi>broken hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in the <hi>pleaſure of God:</hi> 'Tis <hi>zealous</hi> in <hi>Obedience, ſecure</hi> in <hi>believing, quiet</hi> in <hi>ſuffering,</hi> becauſe the Will of God reigneth, and cannot be diſappointed: It makes the Soul in all things <hi>give thanks,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce evermore:</hi> It <hi>grieves</hi> where the Holy Spirit is grieved, and it <hi>delights</hi> where God delights. If God ſay to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Offer up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he doth it with joy; <hi>Reluctancy</hi> is gone, becauſe the Will of God dwells in the renewed Will, and the Conſultations of Fleſh and Blood are mortified. It <hi>grieves</hi> for Sin, becauſe it croſſeth the revealed Will of God; and yet <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth</hi> in Hope, becauſe <hi>all things ſhall work together for good to them that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The renewed Will is <hi>always renewing</hi> it ſelf by Faith in Chriſt, and looking into the Law of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It <hi>thanks God</hi> heartily for <hi>Life, Death, Health, Sickneſs, Succeſs,</hi> or <hi>Diſappointment,</hi> in <hi>High De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> or <hi>Low Degree;</hi> becauſe 'tis <hi>baptized into his Will.</hi> And that the nature of this new Creation in the Will may provoke my heart to withdraw from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109216:56"/> the Servitude of my corrupt Will, I would ponder the nature of it a little further.</p>
            <p>The firſt Parent of the Grace of <hi>Adoption</hi> by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was the good pleaſure of the Will of God in his Decree, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5. and <hi>actual Converſion</hi> by the Word is the Operation alſo of the Will of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. which bringeth forth a Birth in the new Man of the ſame likeneſs, <hi>Pſal. 110. 3. Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power:</hi> and by this the truth of all Obedience is meaſured, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 19. It is alſo the firſt thing the Spirit of God hath in its eye, and which doth (in a way of Acceptation) fill up the defect of all other Service, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>The State of Death in Sin is Captivity to the <hi>Will of Satan,</hi> and the Fleſh: and Subjection to the <hi>Will of God</hi> is the Firſt-born from the Dead; it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and ſo goes on as the living Token of true Chriſtianity, and never ceaſeth till 'tis <hi>filled with the Fulneſs of God</hi> who brought it forth; and ſo it is the undoing Principle to Fleſh and Blood, and captivates Fear, Care and Bondage into the Liberty of Jeſus Chriſt, the Eternal Son of God, and makes Chriſt and a Believer no longer twain, but one in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Operation of the Spirit, whereby the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſure Protection of God ſecures the Soul, <hi>as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> Here I ſtick, and here I groan: Alas, alas, for this day of the Lord: Oh, for this <hi>day ſpring from on high,</hi> to reveal this light and breath, in the Life of this renewed Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Will, from the <hi>rolling bowels</hi> of his own Grace and Spirit.

            <p>This glorius Work of renewing<note place="margin">The uſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> the Mind is carried on by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word of God, by which he made the World.

            <p>Therefore is it made <hi>viſible</hi> to the <hi>eye,</hi> and <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable</hi> by the <hi>ear, retainable</hi> by the <hi>memory,</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable by the heart,</hi> in the uſe of the Scriptures; and ſo doth, in a rational way, by Reproofs, Inſtructions, Convincements and Comforts, bring forth the new Creature, and hold it in a Spiritual Union and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> through a daily Increaſe, tending to the laſt and perfect Fulneſs, <hi>Col. 2. 19. Epheſ.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>And that Jeſus Chriſt may make this expreſs Word of his effectual to accompliſh the deſign of his love to the Souls of his Redeemed, he guides them by his Spirit to the moſt advantagious improvement thereof, that not one Jot of his Word may be loſt.</p>
            <p>The whole Scriptures are the Inſpiration of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt, Heb. 1. 1. Col. 3. 16. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. given to reveal the way of Salvation; which is carried on by a way of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Doctrine;</hi> in both which the State of Mankind is diſcovered, in reference to its <hi>Innocency,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109216:57"/> Fall</hi> and <hi>Recovery:</hi> The State of Innocency and the Fall comprehended all Mankind in the Perſons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> the State of Recovery reſpects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part of Mankind ſaved out of that univerſal Loſs by Chriſt, according to the Election of Grace, and therefore he is called the <hi>ſecond Adam, Rom. 5. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 45. who infuſeth the Gift and Operation of Righteouſneſs to his Seed, as the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> had infuſed the Guilt and enthralling corrupting Power of Sin into his Seed. As the Fall was a <hi>perfect Fall,</hi> ſo the Recovery (to the Remnant recovered) is a <hi>perfect Recovery,</hi> compleated fully in God's Decree before the World was, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. and actually ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized at Chriſt's Suffering, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes applicable to every individual perſon of that number by the Spirit of Faith and Holineſs, and whereby they are fully and really freed from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Guilt through Union with Chriſt, albeit the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting ſenſe and fear of Guilt appears (many times) through the weakneſs of Faith in that Union; and through the incumbring defilement of Sin (in them who are redeemed) holds on a Conflict in the Fleſh, till the laſt Enemy (<hi>viz.</hi> Death) be deſtroyed; and ſo Mankind ſtands divided; the Perſons of them who only bear the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> (corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Serpent's Poyſon,) and they who bear the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> and in the latter, every redeemed perſon carries alſo a <hi>Sub-Diviſion</hi> in his own heart for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>grand Principle</hi> of his <hi>renewed State,</hi> and the <hi>afflicting Stain</hi> and <hi>Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam's Nature</hi> remaining in the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And in reference to theſe two Contraries (<hi>viz.</hi> the Good and Bad Perſons of Mankind, and the different Principles of Good and Evil) the Scripture doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play all the Threatnings and Comforts, Reproofs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109216:57"/> and Encouragements, Judgments and Promiſes, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Rebukes that are found in that bleſſed Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, with manifeſtations of God's <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> to the one, and his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> againſt the other.</p>
            <p>So that whatſoever is ſpoken of any <hi>one perſon,</hi> is ſpoken of <hi>all perſons</hi> in the ſame State; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſpoken of any Action or Qualification in any perſon, is ſpoken of alike Actions and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in every perſon; who is in the ſame ſtate to the end of the World, even as long as Mankind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and as far as the Line of each State (whether it be good or bad) reacheth, ſo far doth every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (continuing in that State) bear his proportionable ſhare through the Grave, to Eternity.</p>
            <p>When the Spirit of God ſpeaketh any thing in the Word, it firſt looks through the State in which any perſon is, and ſo deals with that particular <hi>perſon</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtate in which he is, whether it be a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> and ſo acts towards him according to the rules and method of ſuch a ſtate. Hence 'tis that comforts, or afflictions, or teachings, that are one and the ſame in their own nature, are exceeding different in the end and uſe which the Spirit makes of them, through the different ſtate of <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Darkneſs, Life</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> in which all men lie. So that by this means the ſame Word is a ſavour of Life to one, which is a ſavour of Death to another.</p>
            <p>The general threatnings againſt Ungodlineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every particular ungodly Man.</p>
            <p>The particular puniſhment inflicted upon any one ungodly Man, ſhews what is equally due to the reſt of ungodly Men. And although one evil Man may not commit the ſame wicked Action as another doth, yet he has the Nature, and the ſame evil State, which is the Root of that Action; and as it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109216:58"/> brings forth Actions equivolently evil, it is by the Spirit of God equally ſentenced to Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And as in all viſible Actions the ſtate of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (in the Scriptures) is firſt conſidered, ſo in all Actions the nature and ſpirit of that Action (as it holds relation to the ſtate of the perſon acting) is regarded by the Spirit of God in the Word, before the Action it ſelf, and involves every one within the Guilt of that Action (if it be wicked) or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bleſſing of that Action (if it be good) in whom the nature and ſpirit of ſuch an Action worketh. From this ground Chriſt calls wicked Anger Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and unchaſt Luſtings Adultery, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 21, 28. And from this ground a gracious deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention has the bleſſing of a gracious Action, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. And when the Action is one and the ſame, and yet the Spirit and inward Mind of them who execute that Action different, the Action is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the ſame, but different; as in the caſe of <hi>Cain</hi>'s killing <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi>'s killing <hi>Zimri;</hi> it was <hi>Murther</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi> So that Actions may agree, and yet the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that Action, in the Actors, not agree: and the ſpirit of one Action may agree with the ſpirit of another Action, or the ſpirit of one that acts may agree in ſome particular Action with the ſpirit of another who acts the ſame thing, and yet the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their grand ſtate diſagree; as appears in the caſe of <hi>David</hi>'s Uncleanneſs through Luſt, and the Sin of his Son <hi>Ammon;</hi> for the Repentance of the <hi>one</hi> is recorded, but not of the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in the uſe of the Scriptures, we are to conſider how far Actions agree, and how far the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or immediate inward working, which produceth Actions, agrees, and how the grand ſtate of perſons
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109216:58"/> do agree, that we may know how to make uſe of the Reproofs and Puniſhments, Promiſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that we find given to others in Scripture.</p>
            <p>As concerning the ſtate of Godlineſs, there is no Godly Man has any peculiar privilege, which is not common to all who are in the ſame ſtate, becauſe the Covenant is made to them <hi>all alike</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt; in whom God is become their God, upon the equal terms of Free Grace, and Chriſt is as well the Head of <hi>one</hi> Member, as of <hi>another;</hi> and all the privileges which can flow from ſuch a common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation run down rightfully to every perſon within that relation; <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification, Adoption, Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, Sanctification, Preſervation, Inſtruction, and ſuch like Operations of the Spirit, that iſſue from that relation, and which tend to a living enjoyment thereof, and the advancing of that ſtate to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All Commands alſo and Duties bear with them an equal Engagement to every perſon (alike related) within the ſtate of Covenant-Intereſt; becauſe thoſe Commands and Duties relate to the ſame Intereſt, in which all the people of God are one, <hi>Joh. 17. 20. Matth.</hi> 28. 20.</p>
            <p>So that this Intereſt in God, which is <hi>helpful</hi> in <hi>one caſe,</hi> is <hi>applicable</hi> to all <hi>alike caſes,</hi> wherein the Saints, who enjoy that Intereſt, are concerned: which makes every Promiſe to have a kind of Infiniteneſs, as God is infinite. From this Ground, the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that <hi>armed</hi> Joſhua <hi>againſt fear,</hi> through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and faithfulneſs of God, <hi>Joſh. 1. 5. I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> is uſed likewiſe to <hi>every Saint,</hi> to <hi>arm</hi> him <hi>againſt Covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of Want, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
            <p>And thus the Experience of one Saint becomes advantagious to another, through their mutual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109216:59"/> in the ſame Root of Spiritual Life in Chriſt, by which they are one with him, and Co-partners each with other of the ſame Grace. From this Ground there is no Member of Chriſt that can ſay, he has not need of anothers help, becauſe the Spirit of God, by which they are united into one Body, conveys its operation through one to another, as it pleaſeth him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. which <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is the <hi>new Life</hi> of the <hi>Weak,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Strong,</hi> as he pleaſeth to manifeſt his Power and Vertue in the one or the other, more or leſs, by which they are ſtrong or weak; that ſo they might love, pity and ſympathize each with other, being all intereſted in the ſame Life, and whereby they are all one Body, and Members one of another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that all things ſpoken in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are of true and proper uſe to every Child of God, as far as their condition agrees with, or ſtands in need of that Help, Comfort, Counſel, or Reproof mentioned there; which is the <hi>ſcope of the Spirit of God,</hi> in all thoſe Promiſes, Inſtructions or Reproofs recorded in the Scriptures; as if they, and their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes had been firſt or only in the eye of God, when that word was ſpoken, or that inſtance given, be it what it will. <hi>What I ſay to you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 13. 37.) I ſay to all, watch; for whatſoever things were written afore time (to others) were written for our learning</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells the Church of the <hi>Romans, Rom. 15. 4, 5.) That we, through pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and comfort of the ſame ſcriptures, might have the ſame enjoyment and ground of hope as they had,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally intereſted in the ſame God, who by his Spirit breaths Grounds and Influence of the ſame Grace of Patience and Conſolation, as it did to them to whom the Spirit, through the Scripture had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109216:59"/> ſpoken. And thus the ſame Word being the Inſpiration of the Spirit, bloweth where it liſteth, and the ſound thereof is gone forth into all the World, and the <hi>ſpirit, drift, ſcope</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of the words of Life, to the end of the Earth, as far as the Spirit which breathed it begets any Soul into the <hi>Life of Union</hi> with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Father;</hi> from whom all the <hi>Children of Adoption</hi> receive their Being and Birth through the Goſpel of that <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> ſpiritually ſhed abroad into their hearts. So that every one who is Chriſt's may ſay, the Hiſtory of the Scriptures is for me, the Prophets are mine, the Apoſtles are mine, and all their Propheſies and Preachings, all Promiſes, Reproofs and Comforts, Counſels, Warnings and Examples, the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Moſes</hi> his Vail, and as it ſhines in the Teachings and Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; all things, all perſons, <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> Life and Death are the <hi>Inventory of my Happineſs;</hi> things paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to come are mine, and for my uſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; becauſe the Spirit which worketh in and by all theſe is mine; and Chriſt, to whom I come, and whom I ſerve is mine, and Chriſt is God's, and his God and Father is mine, becauſe I am his, Heir and Co-heir with him. Let ſuch a privilege cauſe the Soul to cry out, <hi>Breath, O Spirit; open</hi> your ſelves, <hi>O bleſſed Scriptures;</hi> and <hi>water</hi> me with all manner of Teaching: Let myſterious Grace poſſeſs my Underſtanding, powerful Wiſdom from God in the Scriptures, make me wiſe to Salvation: Let Strength and Vertue from on high <hi>renew</hi> both Spirit, Soul and Body to all power of a ſpiritual mind, that I may comprehend with all Saints what is the heighth, length, depth and breadth of the love of God in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109216:60"/> Chriſt, and be built amongſt them upon the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets, Chriſt himſelf</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my <hi>Corner-ſtone,</hi> and his Power enlivening me to every good word and work, through that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation wrought by him, for every Member of his Body; among whom, I alſo am allowed to claim my ſhare in the Inheritance of Light, through the faith and patience of the Scriptures, and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, my Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham's Faith</hi> was exerciſed upon the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God made with him; ſaying, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed:</hi> which Faith was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by the <hi>Sign of Circumciſion</hi> that was added to that Covenant, and tried yet further, by offering up his Son; in all which he had the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, and his free Grace and Power in his eye, and ſaw Chriſt's day a far off therein; although ('tis like) he ſaw not diſtinctly the very manner of Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, and the manner of his Death and Reſurrection; yet his faith, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Covenant of God's free Grace, and in his wiſdom and power to accompliſh the ſame in his own way and time, led him to embrace that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (ſo diſpenſed, and to that meaſure diſcovered) deriving Intereſt in God to his Soul, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Juſtification thereby; which the Spirit doth record in the Scriptures to be the ſame <hi>juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exerciſe</hi> of Faith, which in the fulneſs of time ſhould, and ſo did more diſtinctly put forth its ſelf upon Chriſt, dead and riſen, and upon the power and truth of God therein, to confirm, and actually execute in the Perſon of Chriſt the <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of that Covenant, relating to the <hi>taking away Sin, applying Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>uniting Man to God</hi> in the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation:</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109216:60"/> therefore 'tis ſaid, the ſame Righteouſneſs is now imputed to Believers as was to him, becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Faith, and the ſubſtance of the Object of that Faith is one and the ſame. In the exerciſe of which they walk in his ſteps, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12. and ſo are juſtified with <hi>believing Abraham,</hi> and <hi>inherit</hi> his <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Gal.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>And thus the Scriptures, in the ſpiritual uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do run through all viſibly different Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Adminiſtrations, Inſtances and Caſes of the Saints, with one and the ſame <hi>inviſible ſcope, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret tendency,</hi> agreeable to the ſtate of Godlineſs, and relating to all perſons within that ſtate, in all times and Ages; and ſtands anſwerable to the nature of all future caſes and experiences of the Saints; which makes the whole Scriptures which were written <hi>aforetime</hi> to be of a <hi>perpetual preſent uſe,</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end of that Volumne: ſo ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. and ſo ſaid <hi>John</hi> many hundred years after, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19. So that all Scripture is given for a perpetual profit by Doctrine, Reproof, Exhortation and Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the perfecting of the Saints, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>And this brings in again the Conſideration of the wonderful Condeſcention of God, who, though he be <hi>inviſible,</hi> yet he doth (in a ſort) become <hi>viſible</hi> in the Word: there the Life of God is manifeſted, even that hidden Life which enlivens the new Man, it expoſeth it ſelf to be <hi>ſeen, heard</hi> and <hi>handled</hi> by the thoughts of Worm-like Man, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>God, who was pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf in the Fleſh, has carried on a <hi>correſpondent method</hi> in a way ſuitable to Humanity, ever ſince the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> was promiſed to the Seed of the Woman. The Spirit brings forth all its ſpecial Operations, in the exerciſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109216:61"/> of Man's Nature, Reaſon, Underſtanding, Will, Affections and Paſſions. The Scriptures ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak nothing (oft-times) but meer Man, whereas that Humane way was only fitted as a <hi>Sheath</hi> for the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> to be carried in, through all ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes that could fall out in Man's condition. God, who brought forth all things out of himſelf, doth ſtill manage them, and uphold them; for he is the Life. As his <hi>Purpoſe</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> created the Being of all things, ſo his <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> doth create the continual diſpoſing and ordering of all things; <hi>I create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 65. 18. And therefore, having created a new thing in the Earth, that a Woman ſhould compaſs a Man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 22. he works creatingly in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and application of that Myſtery, and ſtoops down into all the Sences, Paſſions and Affections of Humane Nature, and brings forth the Myſtery of the <hi>new Creation,</hi> under the vail and external uſe of the matter of the firſt Creation; which runs through the whole Hiſtory of outward Providences, and through every Branch of <hi>Moſes's Law,</hi> in all the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> every part of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> and through every Diſpenſation, and among all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the <hi>rational Soul,</hi> as the power of <hi>Life</hi> ſtriving againſt <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> againſt <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> which is the ſcope of what we find ſpoken to Man, or of; or by Man in the Scriptures: which is ſpoken, not to ſhew only what Man's natural thoughts are, but how the Spirit of God works in their <hi>thoughts, words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> or how the Spirit of Satan natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſinfully works in them; which is delivered to us by the Spirit of God, ſometimes by the Rules of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> ſometimes by Comforts, Inſtructions, Exhortations, Reproofs and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109216:61"/> and ſometimes by Examples and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences acted upon the perſons of Good and Bad, and acting in them.</p>
            <p>This Operation of the Spirit of the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> begets all the Convincements, Heart-ſearchings, Prayers, Groans, Cries, Sighs, Comforts, Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and Conqueſts which we find exerciſed in the hearts of the people of God, throughout the Scriptures, as in a Glaſs, ſhewing the Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Seed of the Serpent, and the Seed of the Woman; and eſtabliſhing Faith, and Aſſurance of the Victory by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Captain</hi> of their <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And God has recorded theſe things in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Word, that all the people of God may read the whole of their preſent State and Work acted in the Scriptures, by the Inſpiration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which now breaths Workings of a like nature in their hearts. The leaſt Groan cannot be loſt, 'tis part of the <hi>Lambs War;</hi> and therefore there is a Bleſſing in it. If the infinite <hi>Purity, Power</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of God did reveal it ſelf only to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it would either diſtract or confound the Soul, or harden it by a deſperate Diſpondency; and therefore the infinite Excellency of God deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends into the Humane Nature of Chriſt, that it might overſhadow, and work in the hearts of the Saints, who are his Myſtical Body (by the Spirit in the Scriptures) in the way of <hi>an Inſtinct</hi> and <hi>new Principle</hi> ariſing from that ſpiritual Cloſure made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and them in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The rejection of the Goſpel, and<note place="margin">The Glory of Chriſts Condeſcention.</note> deſpiſing the Word doth chiefly ariſe from an aptneſs to ſtumble at the <hi>Condeſcention</hi> of God; he ſees a neceſſity to bow
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109216:62"/> down lower, to ſave poor Man, than the <hi>Pride</hi> of Man's heart knows how to digeſt; and therefore the broken and contrite ones get moſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. the Soul who loves him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves his Condeſcention, in the deſign and truth thereof, can never be too low for relief.</p>
            <p>The manner of Chriſt's coming into the Fleſh, and the deſpicableneſs of his Perſon, in his Life and Death, ſeriouſly conſidered, and the Ordinances which he bleſt, and left to us, gives no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> The way of <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom</hi> is to do great things by great means, but the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> doth great things by ſmall and deſpicable means, 1 <hi>Sam. 16. 7. 2 King.</hi> 5. 10, 11. and ſo confoundeth the Wiſdom of the Wiſe; as the Apoſtle argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. from <hi>v.</hi> 20. forwards. Were the truth of this Myſtery of God's Condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention truly taken up, it would ſpoil that repining dejection which torments the Saints about their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and thankfulneſs would accompany all their Groans towards him: he is as low as the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and their way cannot be hid from him, though he be <hi>high</hi> and <hi>lofty,</hi> and the <hi>Creator of the ends of the earth, Iſa.</hi> 40. 27, 28, 29. and 57. 15. The very <hi>Kernel</hi> of the <hi>Goſpels Glory</hi> lies in the extreamneſs of his Condeſcention in the way of ſaving Man: his deſign is to exalt his Glory to the higheſt Heavens, by the unſpeakable lowneſs of his ſtooping through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the day of Grace. He doth, by his Spirit, <hi>wait, weep, ſtrive, grieve, ſigh, ſuffer</hi> and <hi>complain</hi> in the hearts of his people; and <hi>figuratively,</hi> he is ſaid to do ſuch things alſo himſelf on their behalf; their weak Faith is mighty through him who works it, and <hi>who carries his Lambs in his Arms.</hi> His infinite Greatneſs is not at all the cauſe of any eſtranged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109216:62"/> betwixt him and Mankind in this day of Grace; but the carnal and unbroken Pride, and fulneſs of a ſelf-righteous, careleſs, ignorant, unbelieving heart. He ſetteth the Solitary in Families, and ſtoopeth down to deliver them who are ſenſible of their Chains; but the <hi>Rebellious dwelleth in a dry Land,</hi> Pſal. 68. 6.</p>
            <p>Oh, let this Truth viſit me, and ſave me! Here is a Reſt indeed (O my confuſed heart!) he that heard the <hi>moan of Ephraim</hi> hears thy moan, hears thy confuſed cries, picks up all thy ſighs, and puts them in a Bottle of <hi>Remembrance:</hi> he createth Jewels for himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. out of the Dunghill, and rakes them together into his Cabinet. When thou faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he fainteth not. Lie down upon him, view the Travel that he has made in the Perſon of Chriſt, and in the Word of his Grace throughout the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and ſay, How unſearchable is his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Condeſcention! How wonderfully and fearfully am I made! How undeſervedly, how al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightily, how compleatly, freely and throughly am I called by his Grace, and led along this preſent Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs by the Right Hand of infinite care, power and condeſcending compaſſionate faithfulneſs? Oh, the depth of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God in the Riches thereof! <hi>How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things; to whom be glory for ever,</hi> Rom. 11. 33, and 36.</p>
            <p>Albeit God has laid the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Faith never ſo ſure in the<note place="margin">God in Jeſus Chriſt the only life and breath of his people, and the advantages thereof.</note> Perſon of Chriſt, and ſo in himſelf, as it ſtands revealed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and albeit the <hi>Principle</hi> of believing be planted in the heart at the firſt converting Work, and Covenant-cloſure
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109216:63"/> with Jeſus Chriſt, yet every acting of Faith is ſtill kept in the power of his own Will; and lies lock'd up from any exerciſe, till he open his hand, and fills the Soul with good things. And this God doth for ſingular ends, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That God might be truly <hi>all in all,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> in every part; that his people might both be rich, and yet not able to ſay, <hi>My Goods are increaſed;</hi> that he may appear to be, not only the Author of their life, but of the Breathing of their breath alſo; and that the whole life of the new Creature might not be at the leaſt diſtance from the heart of Chriſt: as the Flame of the Candle cannot live without the Wick, ſo is it impoſſible that the <hi>Faith,</hi> or refreſhment of heart, can live one moment without ſupply of <hi>radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi> deſcending from the Head, Jeſus Chriſt. Which doth not at all ſhew the uncertainty of a Believer's ſtate, but rather tends to aſſure the ſame, by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſending the Soul to God in Chriſt, by whom it is eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>2. It gives check to all allowed ſin, and turning the Grace of God into wantonneſs, becauſe he will not ſuffer the refreſhment of his Grace to be any where, but where he is himſelf.</p>
            <p>3. And as <hi>breathings</hi> are <hi>tokens of life,</hi> ſo do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>influences</hi> witneſs the <hi>reality of life,</hi> ariſing from the Union of the Soul with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. It alſo tends to make the Soul watchful againſt diſtance from Chriſt, leſt the Breath of Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and the Soul faint inſenſibly, and fall into the Myre of a defiled Mind, and ſo into ſinful Actions, and a wounded Conſcience.</p>
            <p>5. It leaves no room for ſloth, or ſleepineſs of heart, leſt the Locks of Communion with God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential Preſence ſhould be cut, and Strength be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109216:63"/> gone; for no comfort or ſtrength lives any longer, than by faith it derives vigour from the heart and mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>6. It repreſents Mercy purely, in that it ſheweth, that the ſtanding of a Believer is meerly at the good pleaſure of God, and doth neceſſitate the Soul to be a <hi>reſigned Attendant</hi> upon the meer Will of God; and ſo allures the Soul by a neceſſary Conqueſt of Love, not to live to it ſelf, but to the pure Will of him who died, and roſe again, and quickens all things. By which Reſignment unto Mercy, it reſts on the heart of Chriſt, and all the Fulneſs of God that is there.</p>
            <p>7. It gives ground of hope in ſad hours; for, as the Clouds come, ſo they go; <hi>There is hope of a tree,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job, Job 14. 7.) though it be cut down, that it will ſpring again, through the reviving moiſture at the root. And why art thou troubled,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> to his Soul; <hi>I ſhall yet praiſe him,</hi> Pſal. 43. 5. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</p>
            <p>8. This coming and going of the Spirits influence is as a Fan, which blows and brings forth the luſtre of all Graces. Hereby Patience, Waiting, and Hope are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, Faith and Love are exerciſed, and every Grace gets (as it were) a frequent new Birth in the Soul; and the ſpiritual fondneſs of the Love is revived, and not ſuffered to die. Every new Breath of the Spirit is a new Application of the Soul's Ingrafture into Chriſt, and Demonſtration of his Power; and is arrayed afreſh, as in the day of its firſt <hi>Eſpouſals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. And laſtly, It gives aſſurance of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Body, of which every Reſurrection by Faith and Hope (freely viſiting the heart, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again to God) is the fore-runner.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:109216:64"/>
            <p>Whiles my <hi>Meditations</hi> are muſing and expatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after the inviſible God, and would fain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his way (methinks) I receive a check from <hi>Zophar, Job. 11. 7. Canſt thou by ſearching find out God, canſt thou by ſearching find out the Almighty to perfection? It is high as heaven, What canſt thou do? Deeper than hell, What canſt thou know?</hi> Keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the revealed Word, and in the patience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scriptures; live by hope; <hi>No fleſh can ſee God and live.</hi> Poor Man would be wiſe, and ſee the upſhot of all things, but the Veſſel of his Underſtanding cannot hold it. Salvation by Chriſt has one kind of Rayment here, another kind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; here it is a Kingdom of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> but there a Kingdom of <hi>Glorious Enjoyment;</hi> here is the <hi>Earneſt,</hi> there is the <hi>Fulneſs.</hi> When I would look over, and ſee ſome glimpſes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> of difficulty ſtands in the way. What an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is it to go down into the depth of Death, and the laſt concluding Change? This is the laſt and great tryal of Faith, to venture all my hope in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at one Caſt; to expect to find the ſame God and Chriſt beyond the great Gulph, who appears on this ſide by the Spirit of his Grace; to enjoy the ſame God to Perfection, whoſe Name I now call upon by Prayer. O that victorious Faith which claſpeth about that Love, from which neither Life nor Death, things preſent nor to come could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide! <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39. I may not preſumptuouſly go up into the <hi>Mount,</hi> but be content a while with <hi>Wilderneſs</hi>-work; there remaineth a Reſt. Return again (O my Soul) to thy labouring, waiting ſtate, be upon thy Watch, the Morning cometh by and by: be not afraid to have thy Night changed into Day, and all thy Weakneſs into Perfection; only
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109216:64"/> labour out thy Task, and <hi>work out thy Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> in this day of Faith and Hope.</p>
            <p>Am I called to work and travel? How ſhall I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo this Task? Contemplation only is not the work of my twelve hours; and Oh, for freedom of heart and underſtanding, that I may accompliſh my work, my Hirelings day. Alas! (dear Chriſt) I am willing to work thy works, but would never be out of thy ſight: May I not talk with thee, and look upon thy face, and yet work too? The preſence of my Chriſt makes any toil to be perfect freedom.</p>
            <p>Methinks I can eaſier find (in ſome meaſure) my work throughout the whole Scriptures (though that requires alſo the teachings of the Spirit neceſſarily) than I can know how to compoſe my heart to keep the Faith of Union and Communion with God freſh; and ſo to work and labour in the ſtrength of that Fellowſhip, whatever I do in the World. When I am earneſt in Contemplation, I fear I fail in the matter of Action; when I am acting, I fear loſing the Marrow of my Communion with my God. Here lies Divine Skill to put both theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as being of the ſame nature, and tending to the ſame end; each of them helping, and not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring one another. And to this end I deſire help from on high, to find out my way and method, that I may ſo run, that I may at length finiſh my courſe with joy.</p>
            <p>The Spring of all Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation<note place="margin">How to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in worldly buſineſs.</note> is Juſtifying Faith, which cleanſeth the Soul, and quickens it at the ſame time, by Union with Jeſus Chriſt: and as, in the order of Nature, Life is firſt infuſed, before any Action of Life can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109216:65"/> ſo Faith, being the <hi>accepting</hi> and <hi>digeſting</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which receives (in a way of ſpiritual digeſture) Jeſus Chriſt, as the Bread of Life, doth cleanſe and ſave the Soul: which new Life puts forth Actions of its own nature; which Actions do add a Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Growth and Manifeſtation, but not of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to that new Life of Juſtification, Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reconcilement. All good works of a holy Converſation are the improving of that Life, but neither the cauſe, nor matter of it; the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it is the meer Grace and Favour of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6. the <hi>matter</hi> of this Life is the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt quickning the Soul, through Union with it; and from thence grows Action, as the delightful Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Life of the new Man.</p>
            <p>So that my more or leſs improvement muſt not queſtion the Eſſence of this Life; the leaſt Action notes Life as well as the greateſt, though the vigour thereof be in a different meaſure: and if I doubt of Life, I cannot produce it by Action. Leaves will not put life into the Tree; but I am in that caſe (by Soul-reſigning and Self-renouncing Recumbency of heart) to lie down upon Chriſt, to receive Life from him. All Life lies in the Root, and comes thence by naked believing; whereby God, through Chriſt, vents his own Life by meer Grace in my Soul, that all Actions of Holineſs may be no other than the Life of God working in me.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Soul may both enjoy its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and alſo act with vigour the works of Righteouſneſs in an active Converſation, there muſt be Order and Uniformity in every Action, ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Spirit of Communion with God: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order there can be no Peace, but Confuſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. and without Uniformity alſo, ariſing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109216:65"/> from the Root of Union that is between the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Spirit of the Actor, there can be no Peace; for Unity breeds Peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 3. by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things different or diſtinguiſhable to agree in one, by ſome common and uniting likeneſs or other. And becauſe this Uniformity ſeems naturally to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ſelf to Conſideration, in the firſt place I would let a few thoughts paſs upon it.</p>
            <p>In all Chriſtan and morally good Actions (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to ſpeak of ungodly Actions, which are plainly oppoſite to the Spirit of Holineſs) no Action, though it be in it ſelf materially good, ought to be left to its own <hi>ſwinge,</hi> but always ought to move in the hand of the Spirit, as it gives direction by, and ſuitable to the Word. The natural motion of a Wheel is to run downwards; yet we read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21. that the Spirit of the living Creature being in the Wheels, it guided the Wheels from their natural motion, to the pleaſure and Will of the Spirit that was in the Wheels; up or down, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or thither, as the Spirit moved them: the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Wheels were made one in motion, by reaſon of their Union. And even ſo in all good Actions, ſpiritually performed, there is a Union betwixt the <hi>Principle</hi> of Holineſs in the new Man, and the outward <hi>Action</hi> that is done; which forms the Action into a <hi>homogeneous</hi> ſuitableneſs to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle, and prevents diſcord betwixt the Action and the Principle. Thus it was with <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>My heart ſhall not reproach me,</hi> Job 27. 6. And hence comes a peaceable Execution of any Actions, when the Principle of Holineſs does ſpirit the Action, and the Action outwardly manifeſt a juſtifying Concurrence with the Principle, in and by which it acts, the <hi>Action</hi> and the <hi>Principle</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109216:66"/> the ſame united Tendency to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Symphony</hi> betwixt a gracious efficient Principle, and a gracious Action renders it a comfortable Service, whatever the work be which is done; ſo the Order betwixt theſe two do add a further ſupply, to carry on a heavenly Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here on Earth. The goodneſs of every Action (as to Comfort in the Execution thereof) ariſeth from Communion with God, for whom, and to whom that Action and Service is performed.</p>
            <p>Although both be the Exerciſe of the New Man, yet each of them act in their own order; the heart is firſt under true warmth within, and then the ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcoveries do follow, <hi>Pſal. 39. 3. While I was muſing</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) the fire burned, and then ſpake I with my tongue.</hi> A good Action loſeth its inward beauty, when it keeps not its inſide order; it is numbred amongſt dead works, and moves but in a ghaſtly manner, when the Spirit within moves not firſt; much like to the irrational Actions of a Man, who walks up and down, and talks by ſome ſtrength of fancy, when he is in a dead ſleep all the while. But when the Root of Communion with God bears the Soul forth unto fruitfulneſs in any Service, that Service is comely, becauſe it ſprings naturally from a Spirit of Faith in the New Man, and carries along the nature of the New Man in whatſoever is done.</p>
            <p>Theſe two being obſerved, would ſo carry on the courſe of Chriſtianity, that in the various affairs of this life, inward Peace would not be broken; there would be readineſs at all times to pray, praiſe and rejoyce. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and this is the glorious Promiſe, <hi>They ſhall walk up and down in the name of the Lord,</hi> Zach. 10. 12.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:109216:66"/>
            <p>All good Actions being thus rooted and ordered, have the Glory of God in their eye, and run forth in way of duty, and carry with them the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Acceptation with God. And although the Actions of ſuch a man may viſibly be ſucceſsleſs, yet his heart is never wrung with diſappointment, becauſe his ſecret Communion with, and Subjection to the Will of God (being the grand purpoſe of his heart in all he doth) delivers him into a holy Reſt, and maintains an inclination to work ſtill without repining, becauſe he is aſſured <hi>his work is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> So far as the Will of God appears, he is quiet with joy, becauſe the pleaſure of his work lies in doing God's Will, and not his own. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God makes up every Breach with an All-ſufficiency: Diſappointments do lock him up within the Sanctuary of God, and keeps the Soul at home, in the pure taſtes of that Communion with God in which it lives, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 17, 25. in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every good work. His good Actions, though ſmall as a Cup of cold Water, or ſucceſsleſs, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s preaching ſeemed to him to be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 4. yet thoſe works cannot be loſt, becauſe Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God cannot be loſt, in the vertue of which, thoſe works were done through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But while I am thus travelling<note place="margin">The Soul ſenſible of a cold Fit.</note> through the Conſideration of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

               </gap> way of fruitfulneſs therein, I feel (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) many cold fits to ſeize upon me; as it was in the day that <hi>Abraham</hi> was troubled with the Fowls which fell upon the Carcaſes which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to divide for confirmation of his Promiſe, which <hi>Abraham</hi> drove away till the Sun went down; and when a deep ſleep, and horrour of great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109216:67"/> fell upon him, then, even then did a freſh aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Covenant break forth upon him, (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13.) So while I am purſuing after this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God, I find the Clouds gather about me, I find not the ſame ſenſible Entertainment of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God in my heart as ſometimes I have done; my Soul is filled with guilt and weakneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am forced to retire back from the purſuing the neceſſary and practical Meditations about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Godlineſs for a ſeaſon, leſt I leave an Enemy at my back that is ready to invade me; which Enemy (if it pleaſe the Lord to ſcatter by his Spirit) I ſhall be more able to attempt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of the works of Holineſs, and have freſh Activity to put on the Garments of Fruitfulneſs, in the Service which I owe to Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, than (methinks) for preſent I am.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inward Rejoycing</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> has been much bruiſed (for certain days) by weakneſs, guilt and diſtraction that has ſeized on my heart; there it lies like a Mountain of Lead: when my thoughts would turn inwards, I hear nothing but Outcries of Accuſation and Guilt poſſeſſing my heart; I can find no ſhelter at home, I am forced to fly abroad for a Lodging, for Company and Food. I am now invited to renew my ſelf a Neſt above my own heart, my heart is grown hard, dark and weak, it prevails againſt my former ſenſe of Divine Preſence; and while it is thus filled with the clamours of Death and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (methinks) I hear the Spirit and Bridegroom ſay, Come, ariſe; this is not your Reſt: lanch forth through the Ocean of Free Grace, and let not thy expectation hanker towards thy ſelf; though thy fleſh fail, and thy heart fail, yet <hi>God is the ſtrength of thy heart, and thy portion for ever.</hi> My work is to go
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109216:67"/> forth; and Oh that I could make a fair Eſcape to him who ſtands upon the Shoar to receive me, it is not a few Meditations that will do it; it needs a Redeemer's hand to fetch me out, and pull me up.</p>
            <p>The delight of the New Man is,<note place="margin">The Soul flies out of all manner of ſelfiſh help, to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt only.</note> to be under the Government of the Spirit only; and all the Iſſues of the Spirit flow from the heart of Chriſt only, by which the heart of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is made new in him. This Newneſs lies eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Spirit of a Believer, which complies with the Spirit of God in the Witneſs of Adoption, even whiles the contradiction of defiled Nature warreth againſt it. And upon the ſingle Intereſt of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and Union betwixt Chriſt and the Soul (yielding it ſelf to the renewing of his Spirit) doth Faith go forth, and claim Forrein Aid, <hi>viz.</hi> the Aid of Jeſus Chriſt, to whom it is united; in Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which Aid, Chriſt firſt takes the Soul more cloſely into the vertue of that Union, that every crumb of his help may truly ſavour of that Relation which is betwixt him and the Soul, through the New Covenant; and gives out no ſaving and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Aid otherwiſe, than as the Product and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of that Union: that ſo Chriſt may be all in all, as the Treaſury and efficient Cauſe of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and that the Soul, through ſpiritual Union on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, might derive that Relief to it ſelf by Faith: and as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Union lies on free Grace, ſo the <hi>Application</hi> thereof, and the abundant help ariſing thence, is carried on through the method of free Grace only; for <hi>Faith</hi> can converſe with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (in order to the Life of the New Man) but <hi>Free Grace</hi> only in the Promſe.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:109216:68"/>
            <p>The very nature of free Promiſes do preſent to the Soul, the conſideration of all Relief to lie origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in God, and that the Soul is invited thither on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fetch it, and cannot poſſibly return empty: for the diſpenſation of which Grace to the Sons of Men, God manifeſts himſelf in the Perſon of the Son, who dwells in Humane Nature, diſplaying the Evidence of this Grace in the Goſpel, and by his Spirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades the believing Soul to accept and improve it.</p>
            <p>And the Soul being thus perſuaded that his life lies in Chriſt, upon a free Covenant grounded in God's Decree, eſtabliſhed on free Promiſes, may not ſtay to ask leave of his guilty heart, whether he be fit to lay hold upon this Deliverance, but muſt rather conſider the freeneſs of Grace, Pardon and Righteouſneſs, which is in this new and living way, which God hath made, and not Man. If <hi>Elijah</hi> had poured only on the parched Earth that was under his feet, he could have had no Argument of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to ariſe from thence; but having by faith prayed to him who governed the Clouds, down came Rain, and the Drought vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>Guilt of Sin is like a Hedge, or a Wall, that can eaſily keep the heart in Impenitency and Unbelief; but when Faith, working by Repentance, ſeizeth on Jeſus Chriſt, it gives Wings to the Soul of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to fly up above all thoſe hindrances of natural Guilt and Weakneſs; and though Sin and Death remain in his Fleſh, yet he is got beyond the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Law of Sin, which can no more keep him from the Freedom wherewith Chriſt hath made him free, than a Hedge can keep an Eagle from ſoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the Air. The Sap which feeds Guilt is Unbelief; now when the Sap is withdrawn, the Tree dies away by degrees, although it remains in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109216:68"/> its place for a ſeaſon: ſo is it with the Old Man; it combers the heart a while, but Chriſt at his death gave it ſuch a Wound that will never be cured, till it has (by the Faith and Prayer of every Believer) bled it ſelf to death. When Guilt ſeems to live moſt, and ſo ſends a Believer afreſh to Chriſt, then does Guilt die apace, and remains only to keep a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's faith in continual exerciſe, and render Chriſt precious to the Soul, as cold Weather makes a Fire the more comfortable and pleaſant: ſo that while my Soul holds cloſe to this, that Chriſt is upon his own terms, Righteouſneſs, Pardon and Life to me, by making me his; and he being mine, my own guilt becomes no longer my own, becauſe I am no longer my own, but his who bought me with his blood; and as guilt is removed, ſo the fear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away is removed, and relief againſt daily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities provided for. If, being an Enemy, I was reconciled by his <hi>Death,</hi> much more, being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, ſhall I be daily ſaved by his <hi>Life, Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>But whence ariſeth this, that I<note place="margin">Faith only a relief againſt daily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> find it harder to relie on him for power againſt daily infirmities, than againſt the power of condemning Guilt? Daily Infirmities are the leſſer Enemies; but yet they are preſent Enemies, and ſeeming ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in ſtature than the great bulk of univerſal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Guilt; the Soul of a Chriſtian is apt to ſtep forth againſt them in his own ſtrength and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo returns many times with ſhame; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſame Covenant which takes away the <hi>ſtony heart</hi> and ſtate of Guilt is that only which gives a <hi>heart of fleſh,</hi> and cleanſeth the Soul from all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. I cannot therefore mortifie one fooliſh, filthy or diſtracted thought, without the application
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109216:69"/> of the whole power of the ſame Chriſt who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved my great and condemning guilt, and caſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. I am apt fooliſhly to think, that my great guilt being removed, I may, in ſome ſort, take my eaſe, which degenerates more and more into ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſloth and unthankfulneſs: but my daily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are like a pricking Bryar, which continually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts me, and lets me know that this is not my Reſt, neither will my own hands put away theſe Bryars; but only the conſuming fire of Chriſt's Spirit ſetting his Death and Reſurrection in Battel Array againſt them. So that I ſee, if ever I expect a good hour in this World, or to all Eternity, it muſt be only, and all over in Jeſus Chriſt. O curſed Nature, O curſed Sloth! that is ever dividing that which a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Covenant of Grace has joyned together; Jeſus Chriſt and my Soul. All his drift towards me is, that he might be <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all</hi> to me. Oh that he would vent himſelf, and ſpare not: he that bids me <hi>fear not, only believe,</hi> is only able to make me believe I often draw near (methinks) to ſome Reſignation to him, with ſome univerſal ſcope, but am quickly gravelled again; yet ſo much delight remains in the very hope of my Soul towards him, that makes me chuſe rather to have my eyes towards him, though with a long look, than to ſay within my heart, <hi>My Beloved will never come: ſurely he will yet come, and his Reward is with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Reſignation</hi> to God is ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Nature, Ground, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties<note place="margin">Reſignation.</note> and encouraging Privileges of it, that the very glimpſe thereof makes my heart light, and even faint for deſire to be wholly ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up and tranſlated (in Spirit, Soul and Body) into the <hi>pure Reſt,</hi> and <hi>Cryſtal Life</hi> of God; but the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109216:69"/> nature of it I can no more expreſs, than a Man's Penſil can draw the Portraicture of a Man's Life, or repreſent the nature of a Taſte; albeit, it may draw the Figure of a Humane Body, or repreſent the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Food, in which lies that hidden quality of Life and Taſte. But if words may be uſed about it, I would thus expreſs it:</p>
            <p>'Tis an <hi>allaying delightful, willing</hi>
               <note place="margin">The nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</note> 
               <hi>open-hearted diſſolving of all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, cares and enjoyments of things preſent and to come, relating to Soul and Body, into the heart, and unlimited diſpoſure of God in Jeſus Chriſt my Lord; with an endleſs, victorious Security of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, Conſolation and Peace of heart and Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ground of which glorious, active and Soul-quickning Reſt is<note place="margin">The Ground of it.</note> Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, who has received his Redeemed to the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 7.

            <p>In all theſe reſpects <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> becomes <hi>the ground and attractive cauſe of Reſignation,</hi> as he is God and Man; bringing the Soul, through Union with his Humanity, to God, with whom he is perſonally united, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. into which Union every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is received, through the Myſtery of his free Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. and the Application of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Soul by Faith, breeds this bleſſed Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for Chriſt being thus qualified in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thus uniting the Soul to himſelf by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, begets in the heart, through believing, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable <hi>Counterpane</hi> of <hi>Conformity</hi> and Quiet in the Inward Man, which cannot be capable of loſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109216:70"/> the unchangeable God is the Author and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Cauſe thereof, nor be obſtructed (while Faith holds up its exerciſe therein;) but runs out into an infiniteneſs of Satisfaction in all caſes; becauſe it is got with the help, and expiating boundleſs Intereſt of him who is infinite. It enters in by the Door of his Manhood, to the partaking of whatever he is Heir to; and is made Heir with him of his <hi>Conqueſt, Fulneſs, Security, Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy:</hi> ſo that albeit the Fleſh may fail, God, being the portion of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, faileth not, but always unchangeably continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Myſtery of this Union, to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and effecting Cauſe of a Believer's Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, as into the hands of a faithful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is the glorious Model of Reſignation; for God, in Chriſt, reſigned up himſelf to the Nature of Man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. and being the Eternal Son, reſigned up himſelf to the Will of his Father, to be made a Servant; and he who is the Law-giver reſigns himſelf ſubject to the Law; <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> reſigns himſelf to the Curſe of the Law; he reſigns up the freedom of his own Will to a voluntary Covenant; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes (as it were) the encumbrance of a Family, and accounts the cries of many Infants about him no diſturbance, but a delight; he reſigned up his Body to death, and became of no Reputation, that out of his Duſt he might bring many Sons to Glory; he reſigned up his heart to bear their ſins and ſorrows; he hath reſigned up whatever he is to be theirs, that they might be his, and be ſaved, both living and dying, from all wants and fears, through his Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of himſelf to ſtand or fall with them, and from every part of his Reſignation, ſends forth his Spirit to work Reſignation alſo in them, according
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109216:70"/> to the meaſure of his own Gift, in every part of his myſtical Body, by virtue of that Union to which he hath called them with himſelf: and herein lies the ground and foundation of a Believer's holy Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Properties</hi> of this holy<note place="margin">Properties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</note> Reſignation, there is a notion of weakneſs and ſubjection in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and of Power and Dominion in the Perſon to whom Reſignation is made. There is alſo an Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſome proper and private Intereſt, and a change thereof into the Intereſt of another. And ſo it is in the Reſignation of the Soul to God. The Soul being ſenſible of its own inability, bequeaths it ſelf to the Almighty Redeemer, and doth ſubject it ſelf to the Rules of his Dominion, as the Clay to the hand of the Potter; and ſo every Nerve of the Soul is looſed, and lies down at the Will and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of the Lord, to do as it ſeemeth good unto him; and ſo the Soul ceaſeth from its own private Intereſt, and ſubmits it ſelf to the Merit, Mercy and Laws of the Mediator, to be dieted, cloathed and employed by him only, and lives no longer by the Life of his own hand, <hi>Iſa. 57. 10. Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. Now he ſtretcheth forth his hands, and another girds him, and leads him whither his fleſhly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would not; he knows never a ſtep of his way, but as the Word and Spirit guides him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 16. he dares not ſay his Sins are his own, nor his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs his own, but as Chriſt, in the Goſpel, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects and ſuffers him to think and ſpeak; he can neither accuſe nor excuſe himſelf, neither judge nor acquit himſelf any otherwiſe than as he who bought him will allow, and give his conſent, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 7, 8. becauſe he is now uuder the Dominion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109216:71"/> of another; and is no longer his own, but married to him who was raiſed from the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſignation</hi> is a <hi>free Act,</hi> and is managed in the Will, aiming to prevent a greater Evil, or obtain a greater Good; and therefore carries ſome content and delight with it, and which is ſo much the more increaſed, as the Power, Authority and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Perſon reſigned to is great and ſure; ſo is it with a Believer's Reſignation to God in Jeſus Chriſt: every glimpſe of his infinite Power, Truth and Mercy, redounds to the increaſe of a Believer's refreſhment, becauſe he hath a Right therein (by Reſignation thereunto) in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, and it eyes his Perſon in all the Worth, Perfection and Excellency thereof, in ſuch a way of propriety therein, that it affecteth the heart, and makes way for the influence of that worth to enter upon the Mind and Affections, and ſo renders it active, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind of Chriſt, and Spirit of the Goſpel, to obey, believe and live upon that Mind of Chriſt, repreſented to the Underſtanding; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his Worth by a ſanctified Application to every part of the New Man, as a holy Oyl, ſinking into every Faculty of the Soul, and naturally incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it to every Exerciſe of that new State, to which it is begotten and brought forth by a ſpiritual Reſignation.</p>
            <p>The bleſſed <hi>Privileges</hi> which ariſe from hence are innumerable, as God,<note place="margin">Privileges of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</note> to whom the Reſignment is made, is unmeaſurable and infinite. The Soul of a reſigning Believer enters into <hi>Purity, Eſtabliſhment, Protection, Peace, Love, Liberty, Boldneſs, Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in the Holy Spirit, and gains an entrance abundantly into the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:109216:71"/>
            <p>As a Stick of Wood caſt into the fire, is changed into the property of<note place="margin">Purity.</note> that fire, ſo the caſting of the Soul into the Blood of the immaculate Lamb, abides no longer filthy, but ſpotleſs, through the price and preciouſneſs of that Blood; the Spirit of which Blood removes the Conſcience and private owning of Guilt, and transfers it into the Laver of Chriſt's Satisfaction, and comes forth cloathed with Pardon, Righteouſneſs and Acceptation in the ſight of God, the righteous Judge, who has conſtituted a Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to himſelf by ſuch a method, that his Mercy to a Sinner might be an Act of Righteouſneſs to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Mediator; and that, by Reſignation to Chriſt, a Believer might enjoy it in enjoying Chriſt, whoſe nature is alſo ſhed abroad in the heart by the waſhing of the new Birth, through the Word of his Grace, to mortifie and cleanſe the heart, as a Seal of Implantation into the perfect Righteouſneſs and Acceptation of his Perſon who bought it with his Blood, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Reſignation</hi> gives <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,</hi> by engaging him who<note place="margin">Eſtabliſhment.</note> bears up the Pillars of the Earth to bear a poor ſinner's weight, and keep it from reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Reſignation doth incorporate a Believer into the very Rock of Ages; it conveyeth a Sinner through the Word of Free Grace and Power, clean from his own ſin, and gives it an Arrival in the very Breaſt of Chriſt, where it abides without ſin or change, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6. Though ſin remain in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man, and dwells with Humane Fleſh, through the whole Circuit of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi>'s ſtate, yet Faith rejoyns the Soul into the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> who is <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure,</hi> as the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> is <hi>wholly ſinful.</hi> So that a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109216:72"/> ſinner, in coming to him, reſigns himſelf up from perfect ſin, to perfect purity. The Body of Chriſt, as it is myſtically below, remains for a ſeaſon under the waſhing of the Word; but as it is myſtically married to Chriſt riſen from the Dead, and ſitting at the Right Hand of God with him, 'tis pure as the Sun in its brightneſs, and eſtabliſhed for ever above all ſhaking ſtorms of the lower Region, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Guilt, Change</hi> or <hi>Danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſignation</hi> doth naturally claim <hi>Protection,</hi> as appears in the caſe of<note place="margin">Protection.</note> the <hi>Gibeonites, Joſh.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 6. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Pity would induce a noble Mind to help the diſtreſſed, though there were no propriety of the diſtreſſed to move ſuch a noble Mind. It were cruelty to ſuffer a Neighbour's Ox to lie in the Ditch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome real willingneſs to help it out; but <hi>Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives a propriety in the Reſigned, to the perſon to whom the Reſignment is made:</hi> and therefore Chriſt owns the cheriſhing and protection of a reſigning Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Conjugal Propriety, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 29. No man ever yet hated his own fleſh;</hi> and not only <hi>protecteth,</hi> but <hi>nouriſheth</hi> it, <hi>viz. as Chriſt the Church.</hi> This Propriety makes every Branch of the Wants, Griefs, Burdens or Dangers that every reſigning Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever has, to be Chriſt's Concernment as truly, and as much (for the nature of them) as the Salvation of all the Elect, for which he came into the World, and died. His Salvation reacheth into every Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their need, <hi>He ſaveth to the utmoſt, Heb.</hi> 7. 25. which ſaving Protection ſtands fitted to a reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul, as a curious Key to the Wards of a Lock, and intermits not the leaſt moment from ſuitable and needful help, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. only he manageth it in his own method, which a reſigned Soul owns he is ſatisfied and delighted in.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:109216:72"/>
            <p>Hence comes <hi>Peace,</hi> when the Soul<note place="margin">Peace.</note> of a Believer, by Reſignment (having viewed the Compaſs of plentiful Redemption the ſtrength of the Rock that is under him, and the Helmet of Salvation that is over him) ſaith, <hi>Return, O my ſoul, to thy reſt, for God hath dealt bountifully with thee. God hath delivered my life from going down to the pit, and my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling,</hi> Pſal. 116. 7, 8. <hi>I will now lay me down and ſleep, for no leſs than God himſelf makes me to dwell in ſafety,</hi> Pſal. 4. 8. The Peace of Reſignation is Chriſt's Peace, which none can divide from a Believer; it is his Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and fortified Security, <hi>Col. 3. 15. Joh.</hi> 14. 27.</p>
            <p>And from hence flows <hi>Love</hi> to God the Father, Son and Spirit. The<note place="margin">Love.</note> Love of the Father in the Son, and by the Spirit, in all the unſpeakable diſcoveries of it, warms the heart into this Reſignation unto him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. Chriſt appearing ſo amply furniſhed to <hi>conciliate Love,</hi> and preſenting the Bracelets of his kindneſs, and declaring his Wealth, Power and Glory of his Kingdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 11. as once <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Servant did to <hi>Rebeccah</hi> in behalf of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he gains the heart of a Believer to forſake former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and reſign up the utmoſt Affections to him: <hi>The more the Soul reſigns, the more doth it love; and the more it loves, the more it doth reſign to him. The Love of God ſhed abroad into the heart by the Spirit, from the heart of Chriſt, breeds Reſignation, and that Reſignation ſtill feeds Love;</hi> each moving other with a perpetual motion; and ſo from an endleſs Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Union with Chriſt, runs forth to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>From whence ariſeth alſo a ſenſe<note place="margin">Freedom.</note> of perfect <hi>Freedom;</hi> the Pales of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109216:73"/> are broken down, free Acceſs to God in Chriſt is gained, Miſ-apprehenſions removed, and Open-heartedneſs interweaves betwixt Chriſt and the Soul. The Heir is no longer Servant, but a Son. <hi>Eſther</hi> is brought from the Cuſtody of <hi>Hegai,</hi> to the King's Palace. <hi>The boundleſs Deity, in all its Purity, Power and Protection, is the Range of a reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Believer.</hi> The Law is removed, the Prince of this World is judged and caſt out, the former ſtate of Enmity and Bondage is over and gone, and now the Soul dilates it ſelf with <hi>full ſpread</hi> into that <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom wherewith Chriſt hath made it free, Joh. 8. 36. Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>Which Freedom brings in <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> along with it; the Soul being<note place="margin">Boldneſs.</note> once reſigned up to Chriſt, is no longer a Stranger, but of his Houſhold; yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed to his Perſon in Righteouſneſs and Tender Mercy, and is always in his eye. Reſignation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and the Soul being mutually paſt, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſwallowed up of Light, there is no ſhelter for the Beaſts of Prey: no Weapon that is formed againſt a Believer can proſper, who has reſigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Former of all things; he may now dwell ſafely in the Wilderneſs, and ſleep in the Woods: a Lyon-like Courage grows in the Soul from the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> to whom, by Reſignation, it is united.</p>
            <p>What now may hinder <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Why may not the Soul ſay, I<note place="margin">Satisfaction.</note> have enough, my Inheritance is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gotten; neither have I got it with my Sword and Bow, as <hi>Jacob</hi> got a Portion from the hand of the <hi>Amorite,</hi> but I have given my ſelf for it. I have reſigned my whole ſelf to Chriſt, and he has reſigned
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109216:73"/> his whole ſelf to me. I own and accept his Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and he accepts mine. What further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, than that I bid farewel to mine own Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Wretchedneſs, and put on Change of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Why may not I dwell amidſt the Flagons, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 5. of his ſatisfying Preſence? I am filled, and my Cup runs over.</p>
            <p>And now alſo, who may hinder a ſatisfied Soul from <hi>Joy?</hi> Will not<note place="margin">Joy.</note> all the Foundation-work and Walls of this Building bear a Superſtructure of Joy in the Holy Spirit? Is not the upſhot of this Reſignation betwixt Chriſt and a Believer mutual Joy? <hi>He joys over his beloved with ſinging,</hi> Zeph. 3. 17. <hi>and her ſoul rejoyceth in God her Saviour,</hi> Luk. 1. 47. As far as any degrees of this Reſignation taſtes theſe high Privileges, ſo doth a reliſh of Joy grow in the Soul. Reſignation brings the Soul into the heart of Chriſt, who hath triumphed gloriouſly in reſcuing his Spouſe, and now <hi>rejoyceth over her, as a Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride,</hi> Iſa. 62. 4. <hi>and in the day of the gladneſs of his heart,</hi> calls her <hi>Hephzibah, My delight is in her:</hi> Which Joy begets an <hi>Eccho</hi> of its own likeneſs from her again, <hi>My delight is in him.</hi> And thus the Crown of Joy is placed on the Head of Spiritual Reſignment. <hi>The Soul cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to God without Joy in him, nor rejoyce in him without Reſignment:</hi> They live in one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Seed and Nature of all ſpiritual Privileges lies in every Privilege; and the Nature of this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege being endleſs (becauſe God is everlaſting) the Crown of Joy can therefore never wither.</p>
            <p>And the more this Reſignation to God in Chriſt gets Ground in<note place="margin">An Entrance to the purchaſed Poſſeſſion</note> the Soul, the more is an Entrance
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109216:74"/> made into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; not as it is a Work done <hi>by us,</hi> but wrought <hi>in us;</hi> in which the heart is made to give way, and is made voluntary therein by the Spirit of Grace. Which Work is here carried on through much Contradiction in the Fleſh, which ſtrives againſt it, while the Inward Man in every Believer pants after it, and finds no Reſt, but as the Power of this holy Reſignation to God in all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails; till at laſt it ſteps over Mortality, and leaves every Obſtruction behind perfectly and for ever; and then God is <hi>all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt enjoying his Spouſe without any Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Unſuitableneſs in her, and ſhe enjoying her Husband without any Vail upon his Face; ſhe hears his pure Language, and returns pure Language again: Love has its full vent on both ſides: the <hi>mutual Yerning of Bowels will then be ſatisfied, the Voice of COME, which ſounds from Chriſt above, and the Believer below, will period it ſelf in one eternal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Meeting.</hi> Reſignation will then enjoy an uninterrupted Delight. How aſtoniſhing is the thought of this? When the thought of it is ſtrained through the weakneſs of my Faith, conflicting with ſo much Darkneſs, and preſent Treachery of heart, and Self-unworthineſs, the Glympſes thereof makes me both fear and rejoyce at once, and yet am not able to rejoyce perfectly for fear, nor fear perfectly for hope. O infinite Redeemer! be over and above all my fear and faintneſs, act like thy ſelf, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and freely, that my heart may ſhout for Joy in the hope of the Glory of God, and the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, which is promiſed to appear: Even ſo come, Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:109216:74"/>
            <p>And now, if I might, out of all theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but take home to my own heart a few Chips to kindle mine own Fire, and be really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned one Inch nearer to Chriſt, I ſhould think the Meditations of this day happily given in. What elſe doth my Soul long for? Some Crumbs of this glorious Banquet, that my Soul may inwardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Feaſt, and ſay, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for me: Yea, Lord, let thy Kingdom come, and thy Will be done.</hi> I wait, and cry, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

               <bibl>Rev. 1. 5.</bibl> 
               <hi>He that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Which Scripture yields excellent Relief to that Soul that can mix it with Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words (<hi>He that hath loved us</hi>) do import the Ground of a Sinner's Union with Chriſt; for ſuch is the nature of Love: and we muſt be one alſo with him, before <hi>ours</hi> can be made <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> made <hi>ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the words (<hi>our ſins</hi>) and (<hi>his own blood</hi>)<note place="margin">How Chriſt's blood doth waſh.</note> being compared together, ſhews, that from Union with him flows a transferring of our ſins upon him, and (as it were) mixing them, without any perſonal ſtain, with his Blood, and ſo made his. Our Infection, by his own Will, entred (as it were) by Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Burthen, into the Blood of the unſpotted Lamb. He ſuffered himſelf, who was perſonally without ſin, to be all over laden with the real Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the loathſome Nature, and abſolute Guilt of our ſins, and ſo became ſin for us; and yet his Blood remained pure, and himſelf without ſin.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Waſhed</hi> alludeth to legal Waſhings for Purification. He removed our ſins from us; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them no longer <hi>ours,</hi> but his <hi>own;</hi> as the filth of a Garment is waſhed, whereby the Garment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes clean; ſo our ſins paſſed away (<hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 4.) by Imputation, and burthen of the Curſe, into the living Body, and Life-blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo the Sinner (as the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) and Chriſt as <hi>Surety,</hi> do ſtand both of them before God the righteous Judge; and both, in ſome kind, equally liable to Sentence: for if Chriſt had
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109216:78"/> not been able to have freed himſelf from thoſe ſins, they would have ſunk him and the Sinner too. And herein the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of waſhing a Garment comes ſhort of this Myſtery; for the filth being gone from the Garment, into the Water, the Garment is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by actually cleanſed, though the Water be never cleanſed from the filth that it borrowed of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe the Water and the Garment are two ſeperated things: but in this myſtical Waſhing, the Perſon waſhed, and the Blood waſhing, are joyned together in the Union of Chriſt's <hi>Myſtical Perſon;</hi> ſo that if Chriſt, who is the Surety, miſcarry in his work, all they whoſe hope of Redemption lies only (through Myſtical Union) in their Intereſt in him, muſt needs periſh with him; and if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, they are delivered: for this Waſhing at his Agony and Death was, in ſome ſence, <hi>Inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and yet accounted <hi>perfect</hi> (and was ſo) as it ſtood in relation to, and connexion with his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which made him a compleat and perfect Author of Eternal Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
            <p>But how Chriſt could bear our<note place="margin">How a pure Chriſt was made Sin for us.</note> ſins, and be made Sin for us, and yet be <hi>perſonally</hi> pure, this is a great wonder; and he muſt be without ſin all the while, elſe he could not have done away our ſins. One Contrary expels another: but he doth it not at a diſtance, as the Light of the Sun drives away Darkneſs before it; but he enters (ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly) into the ſtate of our Sin, that we might enter into the ſtate of his Righteouſneſs. He cures not as a Phyſician, who cures by Medicines, but was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf touch'd with our infirmities; he was made Sin for us; he eſpouſed not only the puniſhment of our Sins to himſelf, but was married alſo to our Guilt,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109216:79"/> and to all the dreadful workings of it, ſo far as that it made him ſick and ſorrowful, even to the very death. He had the guilt of our delight in ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delight in it. He made himſelf guilty of all our ſins, but had none of his own, nor no defilement to his Nature by ours. If one Man be guilty of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſin, he is defiled himſelf, without leſſening the defilement of the other Man; becauſe the Guilt is not tranſlated from the one to the other, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth and ſpreadeth its poyſonous nature from the one to the other, and ſo fills (as it were) both Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, without any remove of the Guilt: but Chriſt's Nature being capable of no perſonal Infection, gives liberty and ſcope to the Guilt of a Sinner to vent it ſelf wholly into the bottomleſs and endleſs Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Merit and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, till the laſt drop of it be gone, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dried up, through Union with his ſpotleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Our ſins touched him, as to an experimental ſence of the filth and burthen of them. He bare our ſins in the Body of his Fleſh, but that Fleſh being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united to the Godhead, remained pure, and uncapable of any Corruption, through the purity of that perſonal Union.</p>
            <p>But how unexpreſſibly far he took in the ſenſe and burthen of all ſin, and made it his own in the utmoſt meaſure, and how infinitely pure he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, the knowledge of this the Angels deſire to look into, and muſt be reſerved, till the Saints come to know, as they are known of him.</p>
            <p>Sin dwells in our Nature habitually and actually, but lay upon him by Imputation; and ſo paſſively, his Nature bare our ſin, but could not act it.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:109216:79"/>
            <p>But how ſhould a Sinner come to enjoy Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from his Sins by a Mediator thus wonderfully qualified, and ſo admirably ſuſtaining a ſinner's guilt?</p>
            <p>This is worth the Enquiry; I may not ruſh into this Myſtery. I muſt be unſhod, that I may enter in, and ſtand upon holy Ground; <hi>No man cometh to the Son, but whom the Father draweth.</hi> I may get the notion of ſomething about it, but can come to no heart-enjoyment without the Unction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt to poſſeſs, and ſo to lead me in within the ſhadow of this Almighty Redeemer. 'Tis wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſom and barren work to gape towards this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by a meer ſpeculative Search; and therefore I would fain make it my deſign to give away my whole ſelf (in every ſtep of this Enquiry) to Jeſus Chriſt, that I may be taught this myſterious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, as the truth is in him, whom thus to know is Eternal Life. And therefore, with a holy fear and tenderneſs, I deſire to wade according to the Scriptures into this Deep, by <hi>the Spirit which ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the deep things of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a foundation for further ſearch,<note place="margin">How to enjoy Chriſt actually.</note> I find that Chriſt himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. and a Conſcience purged from guilt by means of his death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 15. are things enjoyable, and ſo offered and held forth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. My work in the next place is, to enquire how I may actually enjoy an Intereſt in ſo high a privilege.</p>
            <p>I am, in the firſt place (under a ſenſe of my own neceſſity) to lie down at the Foot of God, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Jeſus Chriſt, as crucified and riſen again, to march with all his Train into my heart, and take Poſſeſſion there; and then am to ſuffer his Spirit (ſhutting my eyes, and ſtopping my ears againſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109216:80"/> Reaſonings) to lead me into a willing Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this crucified and riſen Chriſt, my Redeemer; which is a ſpiritual Marriage to his Perſon. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Landskip</hi> of this ſtate will not ſerve my turn. O thou, in whom <hi>all the Promiſes are Yea, and Amen,</hi> renew a right Spirit within me, and let my very Soul be moulded into the Truth by every Meditation. My Guilt has increaſed upon me this day; I have loſt my Thirſt after God, and do find my ſtrength to waſte; my Drift is not pure, and am carried away into a withered frame, and my heart cannot return. The ſounding of thy Bowels is able to bring me back, and enlighten me with the light of Life. An impure Eye cannot behold thee, nor a ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind eat of this <hi>Manna.</hi> My Diſeaſe is great, but there is no healing Medicine to be had but in thee, O my Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Wouldſt thou in earneſt (O my Soul!) be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and effectually enjoy the Redemption of Chriſt? Then retire thy ſelf only to him, and let thy eye be ſingly fixed there. Render up thy Guilt to him who has bought it out of thy hands: Withdraw thy ſholder from the burthen, and with a loathing of thy ſelf and thy ſin, leave it upon Jeſus Chriſt; his Father and thine laid thy Guilt upon him already upon the Croſs: and when thou doſt by Faith lay thy Guilt upon him, thou doſt not crucifie the Son of God afreſh; but doſt only put to thy Seal, that he is <hi>the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> He bought thy ſins to deſtroy them: he ſhed his Blood, that thy Guilt might be condemned; and waits upon thee, to bring them forth to him for Execution. 'Tis not a pain, but a pleaſure to him, that a Sinner delivers up his ſins to him; becauſe the Vengeance he ſuſtained for ſins, has fixed a day
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109216:80"/> of Vengeance in his heart againſt the daily Guilt of his Redeemed; and Revenge is ſweet. Whatever Bryars and Thorns are ſet before him in Battel, he will go through them, and burn them together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4. and 63. 5, 6. He ſuſtained the Curſe, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Juſtice, and returned to his Father with the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his Conqueſt; and now attends in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel upon the Elect, to cauſe them to ſhake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Duſt, and bring forth their Dead (the Slain of the Lord) to the Burial. A Sinner then lays his ſins on Chriſt, when he believes that God the Father laid them upon him. God the Father impoſed the burthen, and a Sinner by Faith concurs, and melteth under the ſight of Divine Juſtice, and cries out; <hi>Even ſo, O Father! becauſe it pleaſed him to bruiſe him: Even ſo, O dear Redeemer! becauſe thou lovedſt not thy Life to the Death, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt redeem me by thy own Blood;</hi> I leave my ſins upon the Sacrifice of thy Fleſh, and would crave leave to look upon him whom the Father made an Offering for my ſins, and whom I have pierced; and in the view of this coſtly Redemption, would mourn over him, as a Man mourneth for his only Child.</p>
            <p>But yet, that I may improve this myſterious Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to the more full advantage, I would beg help from the Lord to aſſiſt me with a true view of the real Exiſtence of thoſe things which relate to Jeſus Chriſt, and God's Covenant concerning me, and with me in him; and what is the myſterious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and power of the actual exerciſing of Faith thereupon.</p>
            <p>The real Exiſtence of all Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privileges<note place="margin">The Goſpel is a real thing.</note> is witneſſed by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; which do poſitively atteſt, that thoſe things are ſo and ſo, as is expreſt: But
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109216:81"/> ſuch is the curſed Treachery of my heart, that the cuſtom of reading and hearing thoſe things makes them ſeem common, and debaſeth their Majeſtick Worth; and ſo beholding them through a literal and common Eſtimate, my eye loſeth at once their true colour and certainty, which infeebles my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, as to the lively Belief of their real Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
            <p>And in order to the curing of this Diſeaſe, I am waiting on the God of Light and Truth to breath upon my heart ſuch a quickned frame of Meditation as may humbly and effectually ſteer my Soul to the Mark which I aim at. Unmortified Invention would be buſie to hammer out ſome Anſwer to my Query; but alas, 'tis a Phyſician of no value: For who can reaſon a blind Man into the uſe of his ſight? He only who brings Life and Immortality to light, is able to make the things that appear not, to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Haſt thou not heard (O my Soul!) that thy true and only welfare lies in things which neither the eye of the Body, nor the natural eye of the Mind can attain to? How ſelf-denyingly then ſhouldſt thou attempt this Search? And therefore, leſt thou catch a ſhadow inſtead of ſubſtance, turn thy ſelf once more (by Prayer) to him who opens the eyes of the Blind, who hath promiſed he will not give thee a Stone, when thou askeſt Bread for thy neceſſity. And then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider, To what end doſt thou profeſs that thou believeſt the Scriptures to be the Word of God, unleſs alſo thou putteſt to thy Seal, that it is the very Will and Mind of God, expreſt in thoſe words of truth? Conſider alſo that</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:109216:81"/>
            <p>2. The moſt ſerious diſcourſe of the people of God about ſpiritual things (although their hearts are not under an equal degree of ſpiritual Warmth) do atteſt, thoſe things are really true. The more ſpiritually any thing is preached or ſpoken, it gives the more reliſhable taſte to their inward Man; and though they are of divers Nations, yet they accord in the ſame main Principles of the new Creature, and the ſame ſubſtantial inward exerciſe of heart.</p>
            <p>3. Obſerve alſo with what Radical Uniformity the Oppoſers of Grace do reſiſt the Convictions of his Spirit. And beſides,</p>
            <p>4. Doth not thy trueſt Reſt lie in thy neareſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to God in Chriſt, as thy Centre, towards which thou art reſtleſly rowling, as the true and real bottom of all thy hope and comfort.</p>
            <p>But wouldſt thou indeed know that the matters contained in the Word of Chriſt are real things? Then never read or hear for meer knowledge ſake.</p>
            <p>Look for ſome Beams of Chriſt's Glory and Power in every Verſe: Account nothing Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but as it is ſeaſoned with ſome Revelation of the glorious Preſence of Chriſt, and his quickning Spirit. Uſe no Conference about ſpiritual Truths, for Conference ſake; but ſtill mind the promoting of ſomething for real Edification. Uſe not Duties for Cuſtom and meer Service ſake, but for Approach and nearer Communion with God.</p>
            <p>Make no perſon thy <hi>Pattern,</hi> more nor leſs, than as ſome warmth of the Preſence of Chriſt appears in his <hi>Words, Walk</hi> and <hi>Converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let thy Recreation be Prayer, ſuffer not Guilt to wranckle, waſh often in the Blood of Chriſt, do not ſlightly grieve the Spirit, but pray for the fulfilling of the Promiſe, that the Spirit ſhall teach you all things.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:109216:82"/>
            <p>Let nothing bar up your way from craving pardon of ſin, and hope of relief. And if you thus trade in ſpiritual things, as real, they will appear more and more to be real, according to the Promiſe, <hi>Joh. 7. 17. If any man do his will, he ſhall know,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But alas, while I would thus muſe my heart into ſome ſpiritual Freedom and Activity, I am again diſmally invaded; my filthy and vile heart rebels, the Prince of Darkneſs hath violently broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, my Conſcience is defiled, and my Peace wounded, my Prayers are heartleſs, I have turned my ſelf round into a Giddineſs; I have loſt my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and am bleating up and down like a Lamb in a large place; I got a glimpſe of Relief, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fix my eye upon it. But what gain I by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Complaint? I have ſinned in the ſight of God, Angels and Men, in the ſight of my Redeemer, in the ſight of my own Conſcience; and Oh that I could pour out my Soul as Water before the Lord! It would be a rich Mercy to me to be admitted to tumble at the feet of my Judge, and get ſo near as <hi>Mary</hi> did, to waſh his feet with Tears, and wipe them with the Hairs of perpetual Reſignation to himſelf, and to his diſpoſal of me; to purge me in what method ſoever, ſo I may be clean, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Abominations of my heart caſt out. I would fain ſay in faith, <hi>I will yet look to thy holy Temple.</hi> Bleſſed be the name of him who is ſtrong, merciful, gracious, and abundant in Pardon. Bleſſed be that God, that Redeemer, <hi>the Lord</hi> (although unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſinful Wretch that I am yet) <hi>my Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that God would yet ſpirit me to enquire into, and taſte the <hi>Bread which came down from Heaven.</hi> I am ſearching after the real Exiſtence of Chriſt, and the benefit which flows from Union with him.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:109216:82"/> And I perceive that my peculiar Happineſs lies not in this, that theſe things have real Exiſtence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but that I know them to exiſt, and my ſelf to exiſt in them, and they in me.</p>
            <p>The things themſelves are ſpiritual; I cannot know them naturally, but by the Spirit of Faith; for Fleſh cannot ſee Spirit: <hi>In the Mount will the Lord be ſeen.</hi> As far as God ſhines upon my heart and Ordinances, ſo far I behold a real worth, and glorious power in them. <hi>In his light only I ſee light,</hi> Pſal. 36. 9. As far as Grace gets life in my Soul, ſo far I ſee the real Excellency of it. As the Life of God opens it ſelf to my heart, ſo far I live, and know the raviſhing comfort of ſpiritual Life; for with him is the <hi>Fountain of Life:</hi> when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his Breath, I do (as it were) return to the Duſt; for in him I live and move. I know no worth in any Chriſtian, but as I partake with him in the ſame Spirit and Life. Divine Commands, Reproofs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts do ſo far affect my heart powerfully, as my Soul doth live in him who ſpeaketh them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of ſpiritual things doth ſo far appear convincing, as my heart is really transformed by them into the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, my Lord, and my Head. Though I have a renewed Principle of Light and Sight, yet I cannot exerciſe the Senſe of ſpiritual Sight, till the Son of Righteouſneſs ſends forth a Beam to me, by which I may behold in the Reflection of his own Light.</p>
            <p>And this binds over my Soul to a neceſſity of a mortified, believing Reſignation to the Author of all Light, Sight and Strength, who is an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rock, and his work is perfect: although I am full of Changes, yet this Covenant keeps me from utter falling: my ſtrength and ſight is ever decaying,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109216:83"/> but he renews his Loving-kindneſs every Morning. O, let the day haſten, in which I may know as I am known, and the ſhadows of darkneſs and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſlee away. I might come to a more real view of Jeſus Chriſt, and appropriate him and his benefits nearer to my heart, if I had practically learnt the Exerciſe of Faith. God has allowed a venturing boldneſs to Believing, that it may ſtep forth and ſtand in the breach when all ſeems to be loſt. When <hi>Lot</hi> is taken, and <hi>Ziglag</hi> burnt, and all carried away Captive, then can Faith turn the day, and recover the Spoil.</p>
            <p>Faith is a diſtinct Grace, wrought<note place="margin">Faith only brings the heart to Chriſt.</note> freely by the holy Spirit, quickning the heart to aſſent to, and reſt upon the Word of God, upon the account of the Truth of God who ſpoke it. 'Tis diſtinct, as Seeing and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is diſtinct from other Senſes. 'Tis wrought free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Spirit, and ſo no acquired Notion; it quickens through conveying Life from Chriſt to the heart by Divine Appointment. It aſſents to, and reſts upon the Word, againſt the Contradiction of Fleſh and Blood. It eyes the Truth of God, as the Fountain of its Satisfaction and Succeſs. And ſo it firſt unites the heart to Chriſt, and gives actual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in him, and in the Covenant which God made with him before the World was; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to all the Bleſſings contained in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>As the Goſpel offers Chriſt, Pardon and Life, ſo Faith takes it freely; not meaſuring the Ground of accepting it from below, but from above. It ſees the Word to be the breathing of God in Jeſus Chriſt, in which all his Attributes are working; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds it (as it were) the audible Voice of God, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109216:83"/> the very Mind of Chriſt. It cannot be ſatisfied in the weakneſs of the Letter, but paſſeth through the Letter immediately to the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, and converſeth with God in him. The whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, in the eye of Faith, is as a pair of Spectacles, through which Faith gets the ſight, and cloſeth with the Promiſe. It magnifies the Scriptures, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Sabbaths, as they are the Portal through which to enter into Communion and Converſe with God himſelf. It believes the Scriptures that makes Report of the Will and Pleaſure of God, and ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through them, to the Will, Mind and Name of God himſelf. Faith viſits as a faithful Guide in its Journey, and uſeth it no farther than a means tending to bring the Soul and God together. The Word reports that Chriſt is there, his Life, his Strength, his Grace is there, and requires the Soul to enter in and take it; Faith enters in, finds and receives it. Faith having found its Object, and eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way how to come at it, is quickned by the Spirit, in pure Obedience to God's Command, to attempt ſome holy Adventures upon the Word; and paſſeth by all Conſiderations of Fleſh and Blood, as deaf and blind to all things but what the Word ſpeaketh: 'tis reſolved to take (as it were) a ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Journey to Chriſt, even upon the Sea; for 'tis contented to feel no Ground but the Promiſe. It ſtays not to enquire whether it hath ſtrength enough to walk or no; but looks on the Word of Truth, and conſiders its need, and ſo ventures; and by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing, engageth all the Attributes of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Spirit, for its relief. If I periſh, I periſh. The faithful and true Witneſs hath ſaid, <hi>Fear not, only believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:109216:84"/>
            <p>Faith, ſo far as it works, doth<note place="margin">Faith doth both poſſeſs the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Judgment and Will, and puts them to exerciſe.</note> perſuade the heart of the Truth, Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God that ſpeaketh, and of the true performance of the thing ſpoken; and is ſingly of it ſelf, through the overſhadowing of the holy Spirit, a principle of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating to the heart the Truths ſpoken from the Mouth of an infinitely true, holy and wiſe God in his Word; and ſo fixeth a bleſſed Satisfaction in the heart, through the real Exiſtence of the things ſpoken, and apprehended by the renewed Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſo far (at leaſt) as they are (by an actual Exerciſe of Faith) apprehended, <hi>Luk. 1. 45.

He then renewed it more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gave it a more viſible Being than ever before that time; and by reaſon thereof, called <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father of the Faithful.</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:109216:84"/> He confirmed it alſo to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes mentioned in the Scriptures as the three grand Witneſſes of this Covenant-favour. From thence it deſcended to the twelve Tribes, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the elect viſible Church. After which, it was brought forth in a Typical Demonſtration of Chriſt, and his managing of all things needful to make that Covenant applicable; which is carried on under the ſhadows of the Ceremonial Law. The Prophets ſucceed, aſſerting this Covenant of Grace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it. At laſt Chriſt comes in Fleſh, and ſeals it with his Blood; and the Apoſtles are ſent ſorth, to diſcover and preach this eternal Purpoſe of Grace to the wide World, for calling in the Elect. So that the Covenant of Grace, which was made of God in Chriſt, before the Creation of the World, appears as the main ſcope of the Scriptures, and iſſues forth its vertue through all the Promiſes; Fatherly Commands, Reproofs, Conſolations, and the Deliverances which are recorded in Scripture, as the various Streams, Operations, Experiences and Effects of the Covenant of Grace, in and towards the Heirs of Life. It bears the Name of the Old Covenant, during the time while the Paſſover was in uſe; and after the Lord's Supper was inſtituted, it was called the New Covenant; both Old and New are one Covenant of Grace, differing from the Covenant of Works as far as Grace and Works do differ.</p>
            <p>The Underſtanding having peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">The exerciſed Judgment.</note> the Scriptures, and ſo made its view, and deliberated the matter, digeſting it by Meditation and Prayer; the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſolves to make Covenant-refuge its Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary; and thereupon, forbids the heart to admit the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109216:85"/> Contradiction of Fleſh and Blood; and the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Carnal Wiſdom and Obſervation, reſolves to determine nothing according to the Fleſh, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſhut up all paſſages by which Unbelief, carnal Miſ-conſtruction and fear were wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and labours to keep open every Port that may admit the naked recourſe of the Spirit in the Word, and opens the Windows of the Soul, to take in the Teſtimony and Evidence of a faithful and merciful God only.</p>
            <p>And when this mighty Diſcovery and Conqueſt is made, the foundations of Bondage, Terror and Tyranny, which before tormented the Conſcience, and enſlaved the heart, doth now begin to totter.</p>
            <p>The Underſtanding and Judgment<note place="margin">The Will aſſents.</note> having gone thus far in the Conduct of the Spirit, do attempt effectually the perſuading of the Will to accept a new Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> the Meſſenger and Prince of the Covenant; him <hi>in whom all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen.</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Conviction begins to ſway the Will, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel</hi> was moved by <hi>Philip</hi> to come and ſee him of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did write; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuies the Conſcience, that God is ever mindful of his Covenant, has ſealed it with the Blood of his own Son, and has ſworn that it ſhall ſtand ſure, as the Ordinances of Heaven, and that no particle of it ſhall ever fail; to which the Will aſſents.</p>
            <p>But alas, how doth my Pen (as it were) gaſh my own Soul, in writing what I cannot heartily, and at full liberty put in practice! Oh that my Underſtanding and Judgment had thus far (in a powerful Gale of the Spirit) led my Soul forth to the Gates of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and thus far brought me within the Bond of the Covenant! How ſoon would the ſame mighty
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109216:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> Power conquer over my Will, to a holy Security and Reſt in believing.</p>
            <p>I am (methinks) like <hi>Jonah,</hi> tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling<note place="margin">My Soul in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.</note> in the bottom of the Sea; the Bars of an earthly and dark Mind are ſtopping my way, and am as lifeleſs (methinks) as if I had no Intereſt in the Fountain of Saving Health: The Weeds are wrapp'd about my head; I am in the Deep, but cannot cry unto the Lord, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And what the Lord is teaching me by this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected diſappointment, I cannot yet tell; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I have hope in him, that I ſhall yet be reſcued from this Captivity, and ſee his Face again.</p>
            <p>I have been ſearching after all my ſins, through the ſeveral Ages of my Life, and endeavoured to view the Depravity of my Soul in all the ſinful Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of every ſin; but I cannot wind my ſelf out: my deſign was to get thereby to a more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Cloſure with Chriſt; but e're I was aware, I had challenged forth more Enemies than I could well ſuppreſs. I thought by aggravating my ſins, to have gotten more hunger after Jeſus Chriſt, but (like over-much cold Water) it damped my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and I found Sickneſs ſeizing upon me, rather than Hunger; a heartleſs Stupidity inſtead of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. I concluded I was (in ſome kind or other) out of my way, or elſe had not prepared my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to keep out the Infection that exhaled from that Body of Death which is within me, as I ſhould have done whiles I was moving the Limbs thereof. The thing I aimed at was <hi>quickning.</hi> Then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that <hi>word,</hi> Luk. 24. 5. <hi>Why ſeek ye the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the dead?</hi> Come not amongſt the Graves
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109216:86"/> without his company who died for ſins, and is riſen from the Dead. I could not be ſatisfied about the ſincerity of my Repentance; and there I ſtuck, till at length, I remembred that Chriſt roſe again, as well to give <hi>Repentance</hi> as <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of Sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. and 11. 18. ſo that I can bring no Repentance to him, but I muſt firſt get it from him: He is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a <hi>Prince and a Saviour,</hi> to give Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Saviour</hi> to take away all the defects of my Repentance; a <hi>Prince,</hi> to overcome all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to create in me a ſound Mind againſt the Infirmites of my Repentance, and my halting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Take then (O mighty <hi>Prince and Saviour!</hi>) this work into thy own hands, and <hi>create a right Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now my gadding Spirit is<note place="margin">My Soul returning to its Strong Hold.</note> brought back again, to ſee that Chriſt is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher</hi> of whatever doth concern the new Creature. And although he be ſo, yet how hard is it to venture my Soul and Body, my whole Hope and Care into his hands by faith in his Word! I had need know ſuch an one very well with whom I am to venture my Journey through a <hi>Warfaring Life</hi> here, and ſhortly, through <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> too, and ſo into the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Eternity.</hi> O dear <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who art my <hi>Lord</hi> and my <hi>God,</hi> who canſt renew my heart, and none elſe can do it; breath upon me, and ſay, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Caſt thy <hi>Mantle</hi> upon me, and let the <hi>Unction</hi> of thy Spirit be ſo ſhed abroad throughout my whole Soul, that my heart may be entirely thine, thine only, that thy ſelf only may be the <hi>Covering of my eyes,</hi> inſtead of all other <hi>Objects.</hi>

            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:109216:86"/>

            <p>Do not hang back, O my poor<note place="margin">Struggles with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</note> heart, whoſe weakneſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy have ſo often bruiſed my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man: O Anxious Unbelief, thou telleſt me, 'tis a bargain ſoon made; but how ſhall it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? Thou urgeſt me with difficulties that will ariſe from the World, from my ſelf, from the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als that I may undergo in my Body, my Soul, my Eſtate; unwonted Tryals. Thou telleſt me of the great fits of Darkneſs, and ſhameful declining I have had, after much Refreſhment, and ſtrong Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary.

Thou telleſt me, I ſhall ſoon be weary of my Yoke, and then my Sins will be of a deeper, and more heart-hardning Die than ever. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Soul-deſtroying Unbelief, I rowl my ſelf upon the Rock of Ages, I deliver my ſelf up to the Covenant of Grace; not to bring ſtrength to it, but to fetch ſtrength from it, and from that word which ſaith, <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace, Rom.</hi> 6. 14.

Let my own Power languiſh into nothing, ſo long as I can claim (on the account of Free Grace) undoubted Right to the <hi>Arm</hi> of God: my own ſtrength never did me good, but deceived me.

Joel</hi> 3. 16. I had not durſt to have promiſed theſe things if thou hadſt not firſt promiſed to do all my Works in me and for me, <hi>Iſa. 26. 12. Pſal. 57. 2. 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 24. Put on ſtrength, O Arm of the Lord! let not thy Name be polluted, and my boaſting in thee turn to thy Reproach. Remember thou art all my ſtrength and life. For this end I would multiply all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God in my eye, that under my impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109216:91"/> of Performance (through that contradiction and infirmity that is in my fleſh) I might be ſwayed by the ſpirit of Faith into the perfection of Strength, and be able to do all things in Chriſt who ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me, and anſwereth for me. Of all the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of God's Commands, he never required me to do any of them with my own Arm, as the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in which he delights; but that I ſhould act in ſtrength every moment received from Chriſt, and ſo work my Works in God all the days of my life. Reveal to thy Covenant-ſervant, O Lord, that ſtrength which thou alloweſt me, that I may know where it lies, and how to derive it to my ſelf for thy work and ſervice, according to the ſcope of this Covenant, which, at thy gracious Call, I offer up my ſelf unto. How doſt thou neceſſitate me to thy Yoke, and allure me by a gracious violence of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to delight in having my hands and heart tied with the heart-ſtrings of thy love to thy ſelf in this golden Covenant inextricably, and for ever. Take me, O dearly beloved of my Soul! nearer and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to thy ſelf, till all the ſhadows be gone; that then I may behold thy Face, and be ſatisfied with thy Image.</p>
               <p>Oh, how ſoon am I now dazled from a pure and diligent watchfulneſs! how many precious Minutes do ſlide away from me? Sometimes Food is my Snare, and ſometimes Abſtinence is ſo too: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Society, and ſometimes Retirement puts me behind-hand: All my Compoſedneſs is ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed. Let thy eye be upon me, O my God, according to thy word; and water me every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. leſt any thing aſſault and hurt my Soul which thou haſt redeemed: and quicken my faith and hope in thy Word for this.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:109216:91"/>
               <p>Many a wretched ſtop do I meet with; pardon me, O my Lord and my God, and renew a Spirit of truth, tenderneſs, ſincerity and rightly ſeaſoned heart for the work I am now upon.</p>
               <p>My ſcope and meaning in giving my hand, and cloſing with this Covenant of my God is further this, <hi>viz.</hi> that through his help I will aſcribe truth to all the words of his Promiſes, by believing them, and receiving them, as that which ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; that I will labour to keep the Majeſty of the Promiſer in my eye, and to preſerve the faith and hope of his fulfilling his Word, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his unſearchable Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs, and not by my uncertain taſte, that no Guilt of Sin ſhall keep me from the Fountain wherein Sinners are to be cleanſed; that I will through the Guidance of his Spirit, aſpire after a more practical and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Exerciſe in living (the life that I live) by the faith of the Son of God; and reſting from my own works, reach after that ſelf-denying Activity which iſſues from my Union with Chriſt as my Head. O my Lord, mould my heart into this life; this is the very Pearl that I would willingly ſell all to get: What a lovely Comportment would it ſettle between the Actions of my outward and inward Man? How would it teach my Soul to rule my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? How willingly would my Soul and Body then be contradicted, and take pleaſure to be thwarted by the Spirit of Chriſt, when the Crown is ſettled on the Head of the new Creature, and the Scepter of Government in its hand, acting as in the Throne of Chriſt, in the vertue of his <hi>pure Life,</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arm,</hi> and every imagination of the heart bowing down before it? Oh, when ſhall my inward Man be thus cloathed with <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> looking
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109216:92"/> forth through all my Sences as the Morning, fair as the Moon, and terrible as an Army with Banners? This Gate of Heaven I would aſpire towards, through that means of Victory which overcometh the World, the Devil, and an earthly Mind; even through the faith of the Son of God. This is that which I have in my eye, although it be as a Land that is afar off. I faint with deſire; ſtay me, and ſtrengthen me with the Flagons of Hope, O thou who haſt ſuffered me to touch the Skirt of thy Garment, and brought me within the Covenant of his Grace.</p>
               <p>When I conſider the Soveraignty of God, that <hi>he doth whatſoever he will in Heaven and Earth;</hi> that ſometimes he has deſerted his people, as to the powerful Communications of Grace; as it was with <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others, in the time of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Back-ſliding: when I conſider theſe things, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſtagger about the conſtant Immutability of God's Purpoſe, and uninterrupted Good Will which he declares in the Covenant, <hi>Heb. 13. 8. Jer.</hi> 32. 40. who ſaith, <hi>I will not turn away from them to do them good;</hi> and <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> And therefore, to obviate this heart-fainting miſtake, I reſolve to nouriſh the faith of his conſtant Love and Good Will in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, upon the ground of his unchangeable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he is not <hi>as a man, that he ſhould lie; nor as the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent;</hi> that nothing can come to paſs but what is the effect of his Purpoſe; that his Covenant is everlaſting, and his Purpoſe of Love therein the ſame for ever, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 35. and 32. 40, 41. that his Purpoſe to them whom he calls up to take hold of his Covenant is wholly a Purpoſe of Love and Grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. that he complains when a doubting heart makes queſtion of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109216:92"/> it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 27. that it is confirmed by the death of the Teſtator, that the cauſe of Alienation is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (<hi>viz.</hi> the Guilt of my Sin) by the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and compleating Offering of the Body of Chriſt, that Chriſt ever lives to intercede, and is always heard, becauſe the Will of the Father and Son is the ſame Will, breathing it ſelf forth to the <hi>Objects of Grace,</hi> by the <hi>everlaſting Spirit.</hi> And therefore, when I ſeem to be forſaken, I reſolve to believe that that deſertion is only <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to enquire what it is that God teacheth me thereby, that ſo I may ſee ground, as ſatisfyingly, to thank him for the gracious frowns of his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Love, as for his gracious Smiles; and to take the advantage of that ſeaſon, to crave his Aid more importunately to loath my ſinful ſelf, and to revive afreſh more purely ſelf-denying Exerciſes of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reſigning to him, fearing his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, patiently waiting when the Spirit that I have grieved, will return again with the Manifeſtation of his gracious Preſence to my Soul.</p>
               <p>In all theſe <hi>Conſiderations, Reſolutions</hi> and <hi>Deſires</hi> in my Covenanting with God, my meaning further is, that I <hi>accept</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> to be the whole Covenant to me, to work Faith, and give the things believed; to work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and give the things deſired; to act for me, and in me, that the Covenant may never fail from me becauſe of my ſins and miſcarriages, in regard he has ſatisfied Juſtice in my ſtead, and brought me into his everlaſting Righteouſneſs, nor I fail from the Covenant through Unbelief, and a languiſhing view of my own Infirmity; becauſe he is my Strength to labour, Author and Finiſher of my Faith, who gave himſelf to ſanctifie me by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109216:93"/> of Regeneration, in the Application of his Word to me for quickning; that ſo Chriſt may be <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all,</hi> to fulfil the Engagement of God to me, and my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in his Name to God. And ſeeing that <hi>Breaches</hi> are like to fall out often on my part, that he would ſtill ſtand in the Gap, that thoſe Breaches may not obſtruct the Good Will and Mercy of God from me, nor harden my heart from him: that ſo the Grace of the Covenant on God's part in Chriſt towards me, and on Chriſt's part for me towards God, may remain in the eye of my Faith inviolable, when the Peace of the Covenant (through my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diverſions and darkneſs) is interrupted and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>And that he would ſtill recover me again into a renewed perſonal Covenanting with God, that in his Perſon I may behold eternal and ſure Mercies, as the Sun in the Firmament, as the days of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 29. And that by his Mediation and Suretyſhip, applied to me by the effectual working of his Spirit, I may in my own perſon be drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſhadow, to recover my Hold-faſt, and have my face ſet towards the Covenant. And that he would ſtill lead me again and again with weeping and ſupplications to God in him as my reſting place; and that he would cauſe this glorious word to ring as an Alarm in my ears. <hi>Return unto me, for I am married unto thee,</hi> Jer. 3. 14. <hi>I will be, and I am thy King: Where is any other that can comfort thee, or ſave thee in all thy wandrings?</hi> Hoſ. 13. 10. And that he would cauſe my bowels to be moved at the voice, and to give anſwer, <hi>It is the voice of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; behold I come unto thee, for thou art the Lord my God,</hi> Jer. 3. 22.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:109216:93"/>
               <p>And that I may now ſum up the<note place="margin">The Soul enters into more ample and expreſs Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God.</note> matter of this my Covenant which God has called me to make, and which, in obedience to his Call, I do heartily reſolve in his ſtrength to adhere unto; guard my <hi>heart,</hi> guard my <hi>pen,</hi> guard my <hi>voice</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> O thou who leadeſt the Blind to thy ſelf by a way which Nature knows not; but thou knoweſt thy own way, and knoweſt how to lead the thoughts of my heart, and words of my pen, and my mouth, that my lips may utter nothing raſhly before thee. Thou haſt made a Covenant of Grace, and often repeated the terms of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and haſt ſaid, I ſhall ſay, <hi>The Lord is my God,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 23. and has recorded the mutual <hi>avouching</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and thy people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 18. in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words.

               <p>I do declare in thy preſence, O<note place="margin">The Soul makes Confeſſion of its Faith.</note> moſt, righteous, holy and gracious God, that (as thou haſt declared in thy Word) I do acknowledge I am one of the Poſterity of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and was in his Loins both when thou madeſt him pure, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Image of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; and when he tranſgreſſed thy righteous Command, by eating the Fruit which thou hadſt forbidden him to eat; and that I ſtand before thee guilty of the ſin which he then committed, in all the extent, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and aggravations thereof; and that I am thereby become rightful Heir to all that ſinful pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which by him entred in upon all Mankind, and rightful Heir alſo to all that Curſe and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which thou denouncedſt upon him, when thou ſaidſt, <hi>In the day wherein thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die;</hi> and that I am by this my nature and deſcent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thy righteous Sentence of Death and Wrath eternally; that I did in that day loſe thy favour, and incurred the accurſed effects of that loſs to my Body and Soul, relating both to my temporal and eternal ſtate.</p>
               <p>I do acknowledge that of thy free Grace, and that alone, thou didſt ſpeedily make promiſe of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> which ſhould ariſe of the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and be manifeſted in the Fleſh: which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly thou didſt perform, by ſending thy only Son into the World, having a Body framed by the power of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in the Womb of a Virgin, and was born free from all that Hereditary Corruption which the firſt Parents of Mankind did derive to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109216:94"/> their Poſterity by natural Propagation, who by his voluntary Obedience fulfilled thy whole Law, and by his death did bear the whole Curſe and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to me and all elected Mankind, in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his Fleſh. And that being thy eternal Son, the expreſs Image of thy Perſon, and God bleſſed for ever, he did fully pay the Debt, and remove the Curſe and deſerved Puniſhment from ſo many which thou hadſt in thy eternal Purpoſe given him to be a Ranſom for, and ſuperabundantly recovered thy Image and favour to them again: And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly dead, he raiſed himſelf by his own Divine Power, and is aſcended into the higheſt Heavens, where he ſitteth on the Right Hand of the Majeſty on high; appearing always in thy preſence as <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> conſiſting of the two Natures of God and Man in one Perſon, continually interceding before thee on the behalf of them whom he redeemed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ends and vertue of his Mediatorſhip effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for their good, and on their behalf.</p>
               <p>That he hath brought this ſtate of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to light by the Goſpel contained in the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, and effectually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed the ſame under dark Types and Propheſies till his Incarnation; ſince which time he hath migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily declared himſelf by his Word and Works: the Father alſo from Heaven, and the Holy Spirit teſtifying of him that he is the Saviour of the World, and that believing in him, <hi>they who believe ſhall have life through his Name.</hi>

               <p>That he has declared himſelf by choſen Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who converſed with him, and ſaw his Miracles, that he is the eternal God, and alſo true Humane Nature in one glorious Perſon; and has appointed them to teſtifie that he is the Judge of Quick and

I bind my ſelf in the ſcope and vertue of this holy Covenant with God, to have tender Affections to all thy people who are the joynt Object of thy Love, and to attend upon the Manifeſtation of the Spirit and Power in thy Ordinances; and, through thy ſtrength, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly to <hi>bear the Croſs</hi> thou ſhalt lay upon me, in conformity to the death of Chriſt; and that thy ſelf and pure Will ſhall be the ſupream mark and object of my Affections.

               <p>And upon thy own Encouragement in thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to me in that ſame Covenant which thou madeſt with my Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſealed it to him and his Seed, that <hi>thou wouldſt be his God, and the God of his Seed,</hi> and cauſed the Man-child of eight days old to receive the ſign of that Covenant in his Fleſh; which Bleſſing thou haſt now brought over to me (a <hi>Gentile</hi>) by Chriſt, in whom thou ſaiſt, <hi>Jew and Greek, Male and Female are all one in Chriſt.</hi> I do again offer up my Child (who has been
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:109216:97"/> already baptized into thy Name) relying on thee to make good thy Covenant in Chriſt to her, together with my ſelf, in every Branch thereof, which I have through thy favour and Grace entred into, and ſpread before thee this day; that ſhe alſo may have a place in thy Houſe, and partake of all the Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Inheritance of thy Choſen.</p>
               <p>And now, O Lord God, what ſhall I ſay to thee? Who am I? And what is my Houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto? All Praiſe be to thy glorious Name, ever-living <hi>Jehovah;</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Spirit. Glory be to thee, <hi>O Father,</hi> who haſt begotten me again to a lively Hope; who haſt drawn me to Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt up for me, to be my Ranſom, and haſt made me to recieve him, and in him to call thee my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Father. Glory be to thee, <hi>O Eternal Son</hi> of the Father; who cameſt into Fleſh, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tookeſt the great Office of Mediatorſhip between a righteous God and ſinful Man, and haſt tranſacted a Covenant of Peace for me, and perfected it in thy own Perſon by thy Death and Reſurrection. And Glory be to thee, <hi>O Eternal Spirit</hi> of the Father and Son; who haſt awakened my ear to hear the joyful ſound of Reconciliation to God, <hi>through the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> which was ſlain from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World; who haſt been purſuing me, and didſt never give over, till thou hadſt convinced my heart, and conquered my Will to a willing Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of my ſelf up to, and a laying hold upon the Covenant of Grace, held forth to Sinners in the Volume of thy Book. Now, O Lord God, let all the words of thy Grace be effectually applied, and eſtabliſhed to me thy Servant: <hi>Pardon</hi> all my ſins and my failings, and all my unſuitableneſs of heart,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109216:98"/> while I have been before thee muſing, and taking thy Name and Covenant in my mouth, and writing it with my own hand in thy preſence; and as a Fruit of thy Covenant-Grace and Truth, let my approach to thee be accepted and proſper; for which end I have delivered up my ſelf, and all that is mine, with full purpoſe of heart, according to all that I have ſaid before thee this day; and with an holy Awe of thy Preſence in this great Work, in confidence and hope of thy <hi>pardoning, ſuccouring</hi> and <hi>aſſiſting Grace.</hi> I lie at the Foot-ſtool of thy Mercy, and call <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>witneſs,</hi> that I have choſen thee to be my God, and thy Will in all things to be my Inheritance and my delight, and the matter of my purſuance all my days, upon the ground and promiſe which thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 23. I will ſay to them which were not my people, thou art my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God.</hi> I have ſaid it, and do ſay it, and do leave this Covenant in the hand of my <hi>Mediator,</hi> to ſee it fulfilled to me, and by me, through all the days of my <hi>Infirmity</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> till I come to behold his face as he is, and this <hi>vile Body</hi> of mine be made like to his <hi>glorious Body.</hi> In reliance on which relief, and bleſſed hope and help, I cling upon this <hi>Covenant of Free Grace;</hi> in which I do both <hi>take</hi> and <hi>give</hi> as I have ſaid, and do <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> it irrevocably with my hand.</p>

            <p>WHen I conſider this <hi>true Loves Knot,</hi> uttered by Chriſt himſelf, and the wondrous Union in theſe three words (<hi>I, Thou</hi> and <hi>They</hi>) declared by Chriſt, at his paſſage from Earth to Heaven, as the contrived Counſel of the eternal God, Father, Son and Spirit; and when I find up and down in the Scriptures, that the Elect (when once they are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit into the ſtate of Regeneration) are ſaid to have their Life in God (<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3.) and that God <hi>lives</hi> in them, <hi>dwells</hi> in them, and they in him, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 13. that their <hi>works are wrought in God, Joh.</hi> 3. 21. that God <hi>worketh in them, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 6. that God <hi>walks in them, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 16. that they <hi>walk with God,</hi> and <hi>in his Name, Gen. 5. 24. Mic.</hi> 4. 5. that <hi>Chriſt ſpeaks in them, and they in him, 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 3. and 12. 19. I ſay, when I conſider ſuch like expreſſions plentifully ſcattered by the holy Spirit in the Scriptures, I conclude there is ſome <hi>admirable Union</hi> betwixt the Father of Glory,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109216:100"/> and every one of his elect Seed in Chriſt; which is a <hi>Myſtery</hi> ſo ſpiritual, a ſacred <hi>Palace</hi> ſo ſecret, that the moſt exquiſite parts of Nature can never enter in, to view it as it is; 'tis <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> under a Vail, into which Fleſh and Blood cannot enter. But ſeeing Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſtery of the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mark 4. 11. I would humbly wait for the <hi>power</hi> of the Spirit to transform and fit me, and the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of the Spirit to teach me; that ſo, <hi>enquiring</hi> I may <hi>enter;</hi> and <hi>entring,</hi> may <hi>poſſeſs</hi> this <hi>purchaſed Poſſeſſion,</hi> at leaſt in the Firſt Fruits and Earneſt thereof: and although (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) I ſhrivle up before the myſterious heat and luſtre of this <hi>Goſpel;</hi> yet being commanded to ſeek the Lord, and being under a Promiſe of help, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. I wait on God for Strength and Wiſdom to attempt this <hi>Enquiry;</hi> methinks theſe <hi>ſteps</hi> do offer themſelves.</p>
            <p>The infinitely wiſe God decreed to make Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the viſible World to be his Habitation, and the Creatures to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>Man is made in a ſtate of Righteouſneſs, and ſo ſtands upon his own legs, and (as it were) in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he begins to totter, and falls from that ſtate, into a ſtate of ſin and miſery; God ſo permitting it, that his Juſtice and Mercy might the more be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: a Remnant of undone Mankind are decreed to Salvation in a way of Mercy. And that the Juſtice of God againſt Sin and Sinners may be preſerved, and yet the Elect Remnant <hi>ſaved,</hi> God himſelf, in the Perſon of the eternal Son, aſſumes the Nature of Mankind into the Union of his Perſon; and in that Nature pays to his own Juſtice all the Debt which this elect Remnant, among the reſt of fallen Mankind, had involved themſelves into; in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109216:100"/> whereof, he unites himſelf ſo near to them, and they ſo near to himſelf, that what he did for them, was reckoned by Juſtice it ſelf, accountable to the Behoof and Concernment of each <hi>elected perſon,</hi> as much as if every one of them had compleatly ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Juſtice in their own perſons; and the Union is ſo near betwixt him and them, that whereas he is the expreſs Image of the Father, and having all power committed to him, he ſtamps upon them the Image of God anew, <hi>viz. Righteouſneſs and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi> which becomes theirs only through Union with him, and do only exiſt in their exiſting in him; which exiſtence is wrought by the holy Spirit, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſpiritually in their hearts (as it formed him bodily in the Virgin's Womb) which <hi>Formation</hi> of Chriſt in their hearts becomes a <hi>myſtical, ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>true Union</hi> betwixt him and them: which ſame Spirit works Faith in them, that they may be made living Subjects, and ſuitably capacitated for this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Union betwixt them alſo and him. And thus the Lord of Life, having enlivened to himſelf a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spouſe, they enjoy each other by an unutterable nearneſs of ſpiritual <hi>In-dwelling</hi> in each other, ſo near, that the Spirit of God, who manageth the Match, ſticks not to ſay, that the Church, and ſo every particular perſon thereof, is a Member of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones; and not only that, but <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit, Epheſ. 5. 30. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 15, 17. Hence it comes to paſs, that from the very moment that the Soul hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of Jeſus Chriſt, being ſeized upon to that purpoſe by the Spirit of Regeneration, proceeding from the Father through the Son, and received by believing; that believing perſon ſo effectually viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Call of the Goſpel, doth now, and never
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109216:101"/> before become <hi>a new Man;</hi> and though Sins and Temptations, never ſo many, do batter and bruiſe, yet his Houſe cannot fall, nor his State be altered, becauſe God himſelf has laid his Foundation on a <hi>Rock,</hi> and has drawn the Soul's Conſent by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to lay it there too, and <hi>this Rock is Chriſt,</hi> in whom the Almighty God receives this believing and renewed perſon into that Union and true real nearneſs which lies ſhadowed forth in the Scriptures of Truth, under the terms of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Child, 2 Cor. 6. 17, 18. Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife, Epheſ. 5. 25. &amp;c. Vine</hi> and <hi>Branches;</hi> yea, as one Body conſiſting of <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members,</hi> and many ſuch like ſimilitudes in the Scriptures to ſet forth this wonderful Nearneſs and Union; from whence it followeth, that no Action, State or Condition of ſuch a renewed Perſon (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be inward or outward) is ſo entirely his own, and of private Concernment to himſelf alone, as it was before; his ſins were more entirely his own damage before; now they wound his Relation, and grieve Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. he ſinned before againſt the Law of God, he now ſins in all his miſcarriages againſt Chriſt alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. and againſt the Law of his Relation to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 38. he bare his own guilt before with diſtraction and horrour, now Chriſt <hi>bears</hi> it from him before his very eyes, and <hi>melts</hi> his heart into <hi>remorſe</hi> at the ſight of ſuch a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, Zach.</hi> 12. 10. Ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl could not expiate one Sin before, but now they all paſs away as a Cloud driven before the Wind, and efficacy of the <hi>one Sacrifice of Chriſt,</hi> to whom, and to which by faith he is united; his ſins made him wander ſtill farther and farther from God before, now they are made (contrary to their own nature) to ſcourge him into the freſh <hi>Application of Jeſus
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109216:101"/> Chriſt,</hi> by whom he draws near to God, <hi>Pſal. 89. 30, 31. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. in all his Affliction he was <hi>alone</hi> before, now Chriſt is his Partner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. Chriſt is truly touched with his Calamities, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 12. his ſmart is as the pricking of the <hi>Apple</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Eye,</hi> Zach. 2. 8.</p>
            <p>As for Loſſes in temporal things, they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Judgments</hi> upon him, they are now gracious <hi>Trials</hi> of his faith and patience, and means of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and drawing him into a nearer reliance on the <hi>Heir of all things:</hi> So that his Loſſes and Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do not now tend to <hi>undo</hi> him, but to <hi>awaken</hi> and <hi>transform</hi> him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. in the midſt of his fears he is not forſaken, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. but through this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt he is ſtill in ſafe hands, <hi>Pſal. 27. 1. Iſa. 43. 2. Dan.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 25.</p>
            <p>Temptations of Satan and his fury cannot deſtroy him, becauſe the Prince of Life, to whom a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon is united, has caſt out the <hi>Prince</hi> of this World, and tempers his <hi>poyſonous Temptations</hi> into a <hi>phiſical Potion,</hi> curbing noxious humours in order to health, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 31. working the Soul to more Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Faith, Prayer and patient Recumbency on God, and Contentment in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>The meer civil Actions of ſuch a perſon, though the ſame ſtill in themſelves, yet in reſpect of the change of the <hi>Agent,</hi> they have ſome different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration otherwiſe than they had before. He ſets about them with other motives, other diſpoſitions, and other ends than he had before; which appears in that, although the thing be done or ſpoken never ſo well to the contentment of others, yet if <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to whom this <hi>new Creature</hi> is united, be not ſerved with ſingleneſs of heart therein, this renewed Soul
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109216:102"/> akes as much as if the Action it ſelf had been done never ſo much amiſs. And whence comes this ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of heart, but from this Union with God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. in that the proper ſway and tendency of ſuch Convictions do bring the Soul ſtill nearer and nearer to God through Jeſus Chriſt, which gives a ſpiritual Diſcovery of the unſeen and <hi>living Breath</hi> and <hi>Pulſe</hi> of this Union? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. And this ſeems to have relation to that expreſſion uſed by the Lord to his people of old, <hi>The quarrel of my Covenant, Levit.</hi> 26. 25. threatning to puniſh them for their ſins, as they were contrary, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Law of Righteouſneſs, but alſo contrary to the Law of Covenant-Relation.</p>
            <p>Yea, all the Labours, Anxieties and ſolicitous Exigents in the affairs and buſineſs of a renewed perſon, do run along through the <hi>Sympathy</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by reaſon of this near Union, cannot but be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner therein; and looks to it, that one way or other the incumbrance ſhall uſher in advantage: he condeſcends to be as one weak with them that are weak, as one troubled with them who are troubled, that he may diſcipline the Grace, and exerciſe the Faith of his people; whereby he glides them along into ſome unavoidable neceſſity of Reſignation of themſelves and their Cares into the Arms of his divine Power, and ſo ripens in them the <hi>Application</hi> of this <hi>Union</hi> betwixt him and them in their hearts. And his deſign being to bring his People, as a chaſt Virgin, to himſelf, he aims rather at the carrying on of that drift, than at the anſwering the natural deſires of his people about Eaſe, or Deliverance any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as may ſuit with that end of his, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them partakers of his holineſs; and whiſpers ſecretly into their ear, the Servant is not to be above
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109216:102"/> his Maſter: I trod the dirty and toilſome way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and am treading over again every ſtep of it with you, and in you: you muſt be conformable to my Death, and ſhall be conformable to my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Come along with me, and your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens ſhall not break you, becauſe it cannot break me; your own projects may fail, but in me you are <hi>Heirs of Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Deliverance,</hi> and ſhall not go without it, <hi>Heb. 6. 15. I will give you reſt, Matth.</hi> 11. 28. He relieved not his own Body againſt the Treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> and the Company that came to apprehend him, although he was the <hi>Omnipotent God,</hi> and had all Power in his hands, becauſe it ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not with the deſign of Man's Redemption; and as it fared with that Body of his that was in perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union with the Godhead, ſo doth it fare, in ſome proportion, with each Member of his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body. Their burthens and perplexities do not at all import that his hand is ſhortned, or that he is really abſent, or had forgotten them, no more than his Divine Nature could be ſeparated from the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, when the ſtreſs of his ſorrow made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, Why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> As that Union carried him through, ſo will this Union carry through his Members alſo.</p>
            <p>It being now about three years ſince, that God was pleaſed to caſt<note place="margin">Some Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in order to the freſh Application, and Improvement of this Grace of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God in Chriſt.</note> the aforeſaid Meditations into my heart; and ſince that time, having been for a ſeaſon a Stranger in a ſtrange Land beyond the Sea, and there paſſed through a dark <hi>Vale</hi> of <hi>Privation</hi> and <hi>Diſtance</hi> from thoſe Ordinances, and that Society which I formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; and having there alſo layen in the <hi>Shadow</hi> of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109216:103"/> 
               <hi>Death,</hi> through a long and lingring Sickneſs of my Body; and being now, ſome Months paſt, returned back to my own <hi>Native Country,</hi> where the good hand of God (which never left me quite deſolate) cauſed me to review the <hi>Solemn Covenant</hi> which (through his Grace) I entred into, the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1660. which Covenant being yeſterday renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and having therein ſolemnly given up my ſelf again to the Lord, and accepted of him in the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his <hi>Grace,</hi> to be <hi>my God</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and to own him in all the Relations of his condeſcending Grace and Love, and alſo to ſubmit willingly to his bleſſed <hi>Yoke, Rule</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> expreſſed by his Spirit in his Word; I find ſtill much longing in my Soul to know him more inwardly, that I might the more enjoy him, and be the more ſerviceable to him: and to that purpoſe, having peruſed over again the <hi>foregoing Meditations</hi> concerning the Union between God, and all and every one of his People in Jeſus Chriſt; and my heart aſſenting to, and being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſhed in thoſe Truths of God, about the nature and advantagious effects of this miſterious Union; and conſidering how greatly the Faith and Improvement of this aſtoniſhing Privilege would conduce to carry on the ends of my Covenant with God, and his (for ſo he perſuaded my heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) with me, I thought it neceſſary to employ a preſent providential Retirement this 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1663. and ſo from time to time, as God ſhall permit and aſſiſt me to improve this Goſpel-truth, of a Believer's Union with God in Chriſt, for my Soul's further Nouriſhment, Strength and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the principal <hi>In-let,</hi> both of new Life, and all ſpiritual Chear, Vigour and Activity.</p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:109216:103"/>
            <p>My <hi>Enquiry</hi> now, then is, how to ſet up this Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſo before the eyes of my Mind, that I may by <hi>Application</hi> thereof, be throughly <hi>transformed</hi> into the ſame Image, and to clear the Pipes, that the Life and Spirit of this Union with Chriſt, and the Father in him, may enter into my Soul, and make me effectually a partaker thereof, <hi>live</hi> thereby, and <hi>act</hi> therein.</p>

            <p>1. The Son of God emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is pure in its nature.</note> in deſcending to aſſume, and be united to the Nature of Man, and therein to the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh; and ſo works up every adopted Child, through emptying it from all the Wiſdom and Strength of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and from all the Guilt and Pollution deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thence, to the Participation of Union with him in the Spirit.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:109216:104"/>
            <p>No unclean thing can enter in thither: there can be no Union, but under Conſideration of <hi>perfect Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> eſſected by the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life which is in Chriſt.</hi> He took on him our Nature, and was perſonally united thereto: By which means the ſin of our Nature was imputed to his Perſon, but could never be united to his Perſon; for he was ſtill <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> while he bare the likeneſs of <hi>ſinful Fleſh, Heb.</hi> 4. 15. And therefore the real ſpiritual Union which Believers have with him, is, in the nature of it, pure and ſinleſs: and their perſons, as they ſtand in that Union, without ſpot, <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 22. for in that reſpect they are wholly brought over from the <hi>Stock</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> into the <hi>Second,</hi> adn return back no more, although the polluted Nature of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> ſticks in their fleſh till its diſſolution and compleat change. And from thence it follows, that the Spirit of Chriſt, in applying this myſtical Union with him, to the Soul, by faith, draws the Soul of a Believer (having ſprinkled it from the Conſcience of Guilt) into a moſt quick and lively diſtaſte of all Pollution; and ſo divides between that which is born of the Fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit; throwing aſide the Pollutions of the Fleſh, that the Union may be purely made in the Spirit through faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. for <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Hence it is, that while Guilt and ſinful Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion invades the Soul (even of a Believer) the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Union lies ſuſpended; and during that ſeaſon, a Believer abides dark and weak: and though he be in a ſtate of Union, yet he cannot have the comfort of it, but is as a ſtrong Man that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find his hands.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> conſider thy own <hi>ſtate;</hi> conſider the <hi>Centre</hi> of thy happineſs, the <hi>Call</hi> of the

Thy Nature is dead in ſins, thou art whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly polluted, and without ſtrength; but the leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conviction of this, doth import ſome ſtep of Free Grace towards thee: nouriſh it, and ſo rowl all thy Guilt upon the <hi>Lamb of God;</hi> be laborious, diligent and frequent in this weighty Exerciſe.

(Oh this efficacious Remedy!) and doth waſh it again in pure Water, removes away the filthy Garments, gives it Acceſs into the King's Preſence. <hi>The pure in heart ſhall ſee God.</hi> But thy innumerable Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (O my Soul) and the continual Recurſion of Guilt and Darkneſs, Hypocriſies, loathſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, Unmindfulneſs of God, Back-ſliding and impenitent ſtupifying Fits, are ſo many, and ſo often,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109216:105"/> and many times ſo captivating this Sincerity, and Strength, and ſpiritual Taſte, that no <hi>Balm</hi> can be found, nor any thing to help, but the <hi>free Bounty</hi> and <hi>Atonement</hi> of him who is <hi>Michael thy Prince.</hi> And even this is my Caſe at preſent. Oh, how little doth my heart reliſh and digeſt theſe things, while I am muſing and writing them? I am eſtranged from inward Converſe with God this day, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſoakingly relent: I mention the <hi>Blood of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> without prizing it at its due value.

            <p>3. This Union it ſelf which I<note place="margin">'Tis only and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God's Free Grace.</note> would come at and actually live in, is beyond, and (indeed) another thing than the Notion of it: 'Tis the <hi>voluntary and delightful Captivity of my Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections through the Knowledge of him who has called me to this Glory and Vertue;</hi> it is my true <hi>Dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,</hi> the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of my <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>Repoſe,</hi> the <hi>Palace</hi> of my <hi>Triumph,</hi> the very <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Riſe</hi> of <hi>Self-abhorring;</hi> which makes Self-loathing metalſom and vigorous, by iſſuing it ſelf into the Soul's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Purity, Light and Strength of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109216:105"/> Divine Nature, and into a ſincere open-hearted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation thereunto. It is begun and carried on whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Free Grace of God; it ſprang from his <hi>elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>predeſtinating Favour,</hi> who worketh it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Counſel of his own Will, Epheſ. 1. 4, 10, 11.

'Tis the <hi>ſcope</hi> of his <hi>free</hi> and <hi>gracious Covenant; I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people.</hi> The <hi>actual In-ſtating</hi> of my Soul into it, ariſeth from the <hi>free Call</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. The overcoming and deſtroying all difficulties that may obſtruct it, is throughly managed in the Perſon of Chriſt, who has made both one; and died to bring me to God.

Luk.</hi> 22. 20. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 17. and the Manifeſtation of this is only by his Word and Spirit, proclaiming and teſtifying this <hi>good Will</hi> of God to Men, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 24. whereby he doth effectually bring in this <hi>Reconciliation, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 8, 9. and effecteth Union thereupon, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20.

            <p>4. Having conſidered the Purity<note place="margin">Improve then by Meditation.</note> of this Union, and the Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is betwixt this Union and Guilt, and unmortified ſinful Pollutions, as to the comfortable Application of it; and alſo the <hi>divine Spring,</hi> the <hi>free Grace</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in creating and carrying it on; into which thoughts and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations the God of all Grace is only able to put ſeaſoning and heart-framing force, to make way for the Application of it.</p>
            <p>Now, O my Soul, compel thy ſelf to the ſerious Meditation of it;<note place="margin">1. <hi>The Reallity of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>

Whence comes this but from the Spirit of Chriſt, in whom the perfection of Enmity againſt Sin lies, and in whom all the Treaſures of Grace are laid? How comes his Spirit to work an influence of the ſame nature in thee, but as thou art taken into Union with him, as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Body, partaking of the <hi>vital Influences</hi> of the <hi>Head?</hi> And ſeeing the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Godhead</hi> dwells in him, whoſe Spirit dwells in thee, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9, 10. and the Divine Nature of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> one and the ſame, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. thou becomeſt (in a way of <hi>Adoption,</hi> and according to the <hi>created Capacity</hi> thou art in) really, at preſent, an Heir to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt, of the Glory of God, and ſhall rightfully (through free Grace) fully poſſeſs that Inheritance. <hi>Theſe are mine, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>I am thy God; in me thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Iſa. 45. 7. <hi>Thy Maker is thy Husband,</hi> Iſa. 54. 5.

            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:109216:106"/>
            <p>Now, O my Soul, meditate again. Am I indeed brought in by Chriſt, to Union with God? Are we no longer two, but one Spirit? Can ſuch a thing be? I do not doubt it, but admire it. What! He that made Heaven and Earth, and all Men upon Earth; he who is the very Life of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he to whom <hi>Abraham, Moſes</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all the Worthies of old prayed, whom they ſerved and adored, who carried them through all Trials; to whoſe Truth, Wiſdom, Love and glorious Power they did bear witneſs, and do ſtill teſtifie it to all Ages?</p>
            <p>Is he my own God? Is this God really mine? Is it the Word of his own Mouth? <hi>I am thy God.</hi> How unſearchable is this Union; is he whom <hi>Simeon</hi> embraced in his Arms, and ſaid, <hi>My eyes have ſeen thy Salvation;</hi> is he mine? He who wrought all thoſe Miracles, who healed Diſeaſes, caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, forgave Sins on Earth; is he mine? He who had compaſſion on the Leper, and healed him? He who had compaſſion on the Multitude, and fed them; who ſpied out <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> viſited <hi>Zacheus,</hi> raiſed the Dead; is he mine? He who preached the Goſpel from Heaven; who did bear my Sins in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, upon the Croſs, in his own Body; who did ſweat Blood, and was pierced through for Sins, for Sinners: is he mine! His Satisfaction mine! His Compaſſion mine! Thoſe tender Bowels mine! Was I then comprized in his Prayer? And is this <hi>Joſeph</hi> yet alive, and his Nature not changed, but glorified to the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Sympathy?</hi> Is he mine? and am I indeed his? He who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted his Diſciples, buried their Sins and Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and bleſſed them; immediately at his Aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the full warmth of his Love, aſcended, and ſate at the Right Hand of the Majeſty on high, where

            <p>By Baptiſm thou art taken in, and by the Ordinance of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> thou art fed and nowriſhed up in this Union. There was no other end than this, as the main Union with <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Head,</hi> and with his <hi>People</hi> as the <hi>Members</hi> of his Body. The vertue is inward: Oh, for more faith and ſight in this Myſtery.</p>
            <p>TOKENS among Men do oblige, and are very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; they carry in them the Mind of the Giver; and the Token being candidly accepted, the Mind of the Giver is accepted; and in that Token there meets Conſent and Union betwixt Giver and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciever.

               </note> his People in Chriſt, ſo <hi>Prayer</hi> hath in this Work an Eminency; 'tis the very Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's own Spirit in them: 'tis the private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in which the Soul is brought into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence-Chamber, and hath private Conference with Chriſt, and the Father in him. The very nature of Prayer is a <hi>Thirſt after the living God,</hi> Pſal. 63. 1. 'Tis the very <hi>breathing</hi> of the <hi>Soul's Union with God;</hi> and the means whereby it is preſerved, fortified, carried on and confirmed; and whereby the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

Let thy Prayers then be <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſingle hearted;</hi> chiefly aiming at, and prizing this Union. And refer all other things (of a remote nature) to the wisdom of him to whom thou art united. <hi>Speak</hi> to him as one, who is in his <hi>boſom;</hi> and conſider him as thy only Helper, and thy moſt ſure Friend. <hi>Come</hi> reverently, believingly, with Reſignation of thine heart to his, and ſo creep forwards into an humble intimacy and familiarity with thy God. This Union only begets the true Cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and nouriſheth it.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Faith</hi> can but enter with all its <hi>glorious Train,</hi> how would this<note place="margin">This Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quickned, and ſtirring in the Soul by faith.</note> Union ſhine forth? Faith ſprings from this Union in order of Nature, but in order of time 'tis brought forth with it. There can be no Faith, or any other Grace, till the God of all Grace hath took the Soul into actual Union with himſelf: and ſo <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Fruit of this Union.</hi> Neither can there be any Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without ſome exerciſe of Faith, in which the life of this Union begins to ſtir; for there can be no Union between God, who is living, and the Soul which by Nature is dead in diſtance and ſin; till <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>firſt ſpark</hi> of <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> do capacitate the Soul for its Union with God in Chriſt. The <hi>Spirit of this Union</hi> (by every ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual means) doth hold out <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> for Faith to grow by; and Faith, by thoſe means, ſettles the Soul more and more in the boſom, warmth and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſneſs of its Union with Chriſt, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him: In which Intereſt and Efficaciouſneſs, Faith grows up, and puts the Soul upon high and noble exerciſe; enables it, and acts it forth to mighty
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109216:110"/> attempts; ſo that the <hi>actual Union</hi> of God to, in and with the Soul is the <hi>firſt Principle</hi> of its life, and <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>firſt Motion</hi> of that life. There can be no Life without ſome Motion, no natural Motion without ſome Life; which quality of Motion does more and more declare that there is Life as the cauſe thereof.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.</bibl>
                  <p>What, know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</p>
                  <p>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your Body, and in your Spirit, which are God's.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are four principal things which this part of Scripture do offer to ſerious Meditation and Improvement, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That a true Chriſtian is not his own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he is the Lords.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he ought to know his renewed State.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That his renewed Conſtitution does oblige him to promote the Glory of God, and live up thereto in Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not your own,</hi> &amp;c. implies three things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That naturally, a Man is his own <hi>Tyrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That true Chriſtianity is more than <hi>ſpeculative:</hi> 'tis a real Change of the Man; <hi>You are not your own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That it doth myſteriouſly divide a Man from himſelf</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:109216:113"/>
            <p>This real Alteration and myſterious Contrariety is not a <hi>natural</hi> Change, but <hi>ſpiritual; viz.</hi> the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Soul, the Faculties of the Soul, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Exerciſe of thoſe Faculties are ſtill the ſame; and yet a ſpiritual Change doth affect them all, and paſſeth upon the whole Man. This ſpiritual Change begins in the moſt hidden part of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mind;</hi> and therefore Repentance is called the Change of the Mind, which Change of the Mind doth influence the whole Man. The Mind is ſaid to be changed when the Spirit of God enters in, and exerciſeth its <hi>Soveraign Dominion</hi> of Holineſs, againſt the <hi>Uſurpation</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Natural Corruption,</hi> which reigned there before: whereby the Mind is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled</hi> into a willing Propenſity of Subjection to the Authority of the Spirit of God, againſt the <hi>Invaſion</hi> of Sin, which ſtill retains ſome Haunt there, as a lurking ſubdued Enemy (called <hi>the Fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit</hi>) till it be deſtroyed utterly at the day of full Redemption.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Dominion</hi> of the Spirit ſteers the natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul in their rational Exerciſe to new Employment, and arrays them thereunto with new Habits. The <hi>Underſtanding</hi> has a ſublimer <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Judgment</hi> a better <hi>Rule,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> a better <hi>Object,</hi> better <hi>Motives,</hi> and a better <hi>End; viz. Spiritual.</hi> So that ſuch a perſon is now ſaid not to be his own: he is not under that univerſal Darkneſs, Pollution and Bondage to Sin which he was conceived and born in at firſt; that was his own natural ſtate, but he is now reſcued from it, and is no longer his own.</p>
            <p n="1">1. While he was his own, he taught himſelf by the Light of fleſhly Wiſdom, and accounted the Goſpel Fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. but now loaths it;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:109216:113"/> and being at a loſs, cries, <hi>Lord, what wouldſt thou have me to do? Act.</hi> 9. 6. and as they did who burnt the Books in which they learnt curious Arts before, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 19. in which lay no ſavour of Chriſt and ſpiritual Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. While he was his own, he ruled himſelf by the ſight of his eyes, and imagination of his heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 27. by the cuſtom and courſe of the World; but now conſults not with <hi>Fleſh and Blood, Gal.</hi> 1. 16. he ſees his own <hi>Byaſs</hi> is <hi>falſe,</hi> and his own <hi>Weights too light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure, Profit, Honour,</hi> do not now draw him: he was lead by his own <hi>Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> but now he is dead to theſe; and ſaith, <hi>I have no pleaſure in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He <hi>deſigns</hi> not his own things, neither <hi>Health, Phil.</hi> 2. 30. nor <hi>Liberty, Act.</hi> 20. 23. nor <hi>Eaſe, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 10. nor <hi>Safety, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 13. nor <hi>Wealth, Heb.</hi> 11. 26. nor <hi>Honour,</hi> nor <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who refuſed to be Father of a great Nation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10. and <hi>Eſther,</hi> not ſatisfied with having the honour and delights of being Queen, when God's Honour lay at ſtake. Yea, he deſigns not an unworthy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his own life, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>carnal Comforts</hi> is gone in ſuch an ones eſteem; as <hi>Eſther</hi> could not endure the thoughts of her Peoples Ruin, though ſhe was at the Royal Feaſt: and to ſuch an one, the tickling comfort of ſuch things affect not, but are as the <hi>White of an Egg;</hi> yea, the <hi>unneceſſary Conference</hi> of ſuch things is <hi>taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> as Meat to a ſick Man; and all becauſe ſuch an one is not his own any longer.</p>
            <p>When a Man is not his own, he ſtands inveſted with many privileges: he has hereby a ſhelter.</p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:109216:114"/>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt outward <hi>Afflictions;</hi> they ſting not, their profit reacheth farther than their pain, when a Man (as in an extaſie) is not <hi>his</hi> own: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Perſecution</hi> on the Outward Man, reach not him who is not his own, who is not at his own home; as it was with <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi>'s Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers came to kill him, they found him not, but an Image, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He can anſwer the <hi>Accuſations</hi> of <hi>Guilt,</hi> I am not my own, and therefore my own Guilt muſt not ſtick on me.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> demands Service, he can reply; I who am not my own, am not <hi>Debtor to the Fleſh.</hi> When Sin doth vex and moleſt by its pollutions in the Fleſh, he can ſay; What make I here? <hi>I am not my own:</hi> Let me go hence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When <hi>ſpiritual Pride</hi> ſolicits, he can reply; What I have is not my <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. And againſt <hi>carnal Security</hi> he can ſay; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain my own Grace, nor reſtore my ſelf when fallen; and therefore am to work out my Salvation with fear: <hi>I am not my own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Againſt <hi>Solicitude</hi> about future Events and <hi>carking Deſpondency;</hi> I am not at my own diſpoſe, and therefore ſuch Anxieties are to be none of my work.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Againſt the <hi>enchanting Comforts</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> it can ſay, as <hi>Barzillai</hi> did to <hi>David; Can I hear the ſound of ſuch Melody? What is ſuch Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to a dead Man? I am not my own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whoſe am I then? Will ſuch an one ſay, this Scripture ſhews, that he who is waſhed, ſanctified and juſtified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) is Gods; <hi>viz.</hi> by Juſtification, by Sanctification, he is tranſlated from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:109216:114"/> the Dominion and natural Right of corrupt Self, to be the Lord's in Body and Spirit. As he did bear the <hi>corrupted Image</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> ſo now he bears the <hi>ſpiritual Image</hi> of the <hi>Second:</hi> he is not <hi>in his own propriety,</hi> as before he was, but is now in a peculiar <hi>gracious propriety</hi> to God.</p>
            <p>The nature of which may be more diſtinctly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by conſidering theſe three Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. What this Propriety is, and wherein it lies.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How it comes to paſs, and was effected.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How the truth, fulneſs, entireneſs, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it, is demonſtrated and held forth in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis a <hi>Propriety</hi> which ſtands diſtinguiſhed from the Propriety which God has in that common ſtate of Mankind in the whole Earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a <hi>Propriety</hi> which ſtands in oppoſition to Eſtrangement, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12, 19. compared with <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In oppoſition to that which is anothers, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In oppoſition to former Unſuitableneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. and Enmity; <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that a juſtified perſon is peculiarly, intimately, entirely, complacently and fully the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. This <hi>Propriety</hi> came to paſs, and was effected,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the free, deliberate, gracious Choice of God; and therefore they are called <hi>God's Elect, Rom.</hi> 8. 33. which Choice was made with reſpect to Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Giving theſe Elect to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 6. and ſo being Chriſt's they are God's, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 23. Joh.</hi> 17. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Chriſt's Meditation and Advocateſhip: whereby</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:109216:115"/>
            <p n="1">1. He takes away all that which neceſſarily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the effecting of this Propriety; ſatisfying the-Juſtice of God, (and removing out of the way that Pollution and Enmity, which ſtood between the righteous and holy God, and defiled Sinners) by the <hi>price</hi> and <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of his own Blood, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſends forth the Goſpel, inviting all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to apply to themſelves by faith, the vertue and end of his Death, <hi>Matth. 16. 15, 16. Act.</hi> 13. 38. and that a Covenant is made betwixt God and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and confirmed in his Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He gives faith to apply the ſame, <hi>Act. 14. 27. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. and opening the Underſtanding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, <hi>Luk. 24. 45. Act.</hi> 16. 14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He reneweth the heart through his Spirit, and rendreth it ſuitable and ſubject to the Laws and ſtate of this Appropriation to God, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 22, 23, 24. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. and from <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. to 19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He preſents thoſe whom he thus redeemed to his Father, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. Col.</hi> 1. 22. bequeathing them to him as his own, to be kept from evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 11, 15, 25.</p>

            </p>
            <p>3. That true Chriſtians ought to know their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are not their own, but
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:109216:117"/> Gods; which ſeem to have theſe (ſteps, or rather) parts included in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>diſcerning</hi> and underſtanding of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſuch a ſtate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An <hi>inward perſuaſion</hi> of the poſſibility of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in ſuch a ſtate, <hi>Iſa. 55. 6. Joel</hi> 2. 14. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. An <hi>Exerciſe of Faith,</hi> engaging the heart to lay claim to, be poſſeſſed of, and actually enjoy an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt therein, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 20. Joh.</hi> 20. 28. and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Means</hi> of this <hi>Knowledge</hi> are chiefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Word and Spirit of God, Joh.</hi> 20. 31. and 16. 8, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Prayer, Pſal. 143. 8. Prov. 2. 3. Job</hi> 34. 32.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Serious Deliberation, Meditation</hi> and <hi>Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Pſal. 143. 5. 2 Tim. 2. 7. Pſal.</hi> 104. 34.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Evidences</hi> which do declare a perſon to be the Lords, are the <hi>Ecchoings</hi> back of the Soul to him in the warmth of his own Grace and Love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God draws the Soul to own him in a way ſuitable to his owning of ſuch a perſon to be his; ſtamping his own Image there, and giving it life to act in a genuine, true and proportionable method towards God again. Which appears,</p>
            <p>1. In that <hi>mutual Avouchment</hi> mentioned in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 16, 17. according to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 7. and 32. 38. <hi>I will give them a heart that they ſhall know that I am the Lord; and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God: and they ſhall return to me with their whole heart.</hi> And this is the Ground of thoſe Expreſſions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, wherein the People of God have ecchoed back their Faith and hope in him, by the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Expreſſions to him, as he uſeth to them.</p>
            <pb n="201" facs="tcp:109216:117"/>
            <p n="1">1. As God has <hi>choſen them, Mark</hi> 13. 20. they chuſe God, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 15, 22. and the things that pleaſe him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God calls them <hi>his Inheritance,</hi> Pſal. 33. 12. they call him their Inheritance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God calls them <hi>his Habitation,</hi> Ephe. 2. 22. they call him their Habitation, and dwelling Place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 3. and 90. 1. God dwelleth in them, and they in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God <hi>walks in them,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. they walk in his Name, <hi>Zac.</hi> 10. 12. They walk with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are <hi>precious to God,</hi> Iſa. 43. 4. and the Lord is precious to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are <hi>God's portion,</hi> Deut. 32. 9. and God is theirs, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p n="7">7. God <hi>loves them,</hi> Pſal. 146. 8. they love him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. In theſe and many other reſpects they bear the Image of God, and therein do evidence that they are his, and he theirs. Let the heart exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it ſelf whether theſe Properties of the Image of God be ſtamped there or no.</p>
            <p>2. It <hi>appears</hi> in <hi>complying with God's aim and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in managing that Propriety of his, in which he owns them;</hi> he commands, and they obey; <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 27. he reprooves, and they take reproof; he threatens, and they fear; he chaſtiſeth, and they accept the puniſhment of their iniquities; he ſpeaks, and they hear; he promiſeth, and they believe: and thus they ſhew that they are his, and he theirs. Let the heart examine it ſelf whether there be this compliance with the Mind and Will of God, or no, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>3. It <hi>appears</hi> in <hi>anſwering the duty of that Relation in which they ſtand to God:</hi> They are the Spouſe,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109216:118"/> and he the Husband; they the Children, he the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they the Flock, he the Shepherd; they the Husbandry, he the Husband-man; they the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, he the Worker; they the Clay, he the Potter: each Relation imports the duty of them who are thus many ways related unto God. All which adminiſters matter for ſeveral Queries by way of Trial; whether God be mine, and I am his. If I am his, he muſt neceſſarily be mine, according to the tenour of the Covenant. And therefore let me propound ſome Queſtions to my own Soul, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from the former Conſiderations; that I may know that I am mine own no longer, but the Lords; and that he is mine.</p>
            <p>For making way to theſe Queries it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the Scriptures do ſpeak of ſeveral ſtates of Mankind in the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Innocency,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> Rom. 5. 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Pardon</hi> through Grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. And thence cometh a ſtate of <hi>Renewing</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24. and 5. 8. which iſſueth from Chriſt's Redemption, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. and ſo lodgeth a Soul in this Propriety of being God's peculiar people, ſhewing forth his Praiſes; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. and the holy God is not aſhamed to be called their God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe relate to all Men univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally; but all of them relate to them who arrive at this <hi>peculiar Intereſt</hi> in <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The New Teſtament ſpeaks but little about the <hi>primitive</hi> Innocency; only glancing at it by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation under the words of Straying, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. Seeking that which was loſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 10. and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Life of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. and ſuch
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109216:118"/> like; and treats chiefly and moſt directly of the others, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin, Redemption and Holineſs: This is that which the Spirit is promiſed to convince the World of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> under Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and of <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> by Chriſt (crucified and riſen) who teſtified and aſſured by his going to his Father, that he obtained eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. and the ſtate of Conqueſt over the <hi>Prince of this World, who works in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience;</hi> and thereby freedom to ſerve God in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>This is ſet forth in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. the ſtate of Sin and Death in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 12. Redemption, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6. and of Holineſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22. And all briefly put together in <hi>Epheſ. 5. 8. Sometimes ye were darkneſs, but now ye are light in the Lord: walk as children of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Conſideration of each of theſe, there followeth divers Queſtions for the trying of the ſtate of the Soul, and knowing in what plight it now ſtands. Indeed the Glory of primitive Innocency is out-ſhined by the ſuper-abundant Grace and Image of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47, 48, 49, as the Glory of the <hi>ſecond Temple</hi> exceeded the Glory of the <hi>firſt, Hag.</hi> 2. 9. yet the loſing of that is much to be bewailed, becauſe we did ſo ſinfully loſe it. Now then, O my Soul! canſt thou take up <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Lamentation over <hi>Tyrus? Ezek. 27. 12. &amp;c.</hi> Thou haſt been in <hi>Eden,</hi> the Garden of God, waſt perfect in thy ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but thine heart was lifted up: and as <hi>David</hi> mourned for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s death, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was thereby made for his own Advancement, 2 <hi>Sam. 1. 19. &amp;c. The beauty of Iſrael is fallen;</hi> &amp;c. and ſay, <hi>How are the mighty fallen;</hi> the Shield of the Mighty vilely caſt away? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How is the Gold
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109216:119"/> of primitive Innocency become dim? And how is Mankind, that was <hi>purer than the Snow,</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>black as a Coal?</hi> as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lamented over <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Lam. 4. 1, 7, 8. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. Canſt thou ſay; Alas, I am become vile, <hi>Job 40. 4. In me,</hi> that is, in my fleſh <hi>dwelleth no good thing,</hi> no Truth, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs; and thy Nature is only evil, and that continually? <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
            <p>II. Doſt thou conſider the nature of thy ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and how it doth pollute, weaken, deceive, and enſlave thee? <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doſt thou know that thou carrieſt up and down in thy Nature all the Seeds of all Sins; that all the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Superſtitions, Blaſphemy; all the Murthers, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Violence, Injuriouſneſs, Hatred, Envy, Cruelty, Falſhood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ever you read of in the Scriptures, or other Hiſtories; or that ever your ears heard, or eyes ſaw: that the Seed and Spice of it all is in your own heart; that all thoſe black Liſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29, to the end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. and 4. 18, 19. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. and ſuch like? Your Nature is in ſome degree or other tainted with it. And becauſe this may ſeem harſh and ſtrange,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider; As far as any Man has the Nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> he has the Corruption of that Nature; and as far as all are equal in their Deſcent from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo far are all equal in the Corruption of that Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: all guilty; every mouth muſt be ſtopped; Death came upon all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. and 5. 12, 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, That though Reſtraining Grace, or Mortifying Grace may curb, weaken, and ſubdue ſinful Corruption, yet it retains its dwelling in the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 25. And though the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt be imputed to the Perſon, yet the corrupt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109216:119"/> Nature of that Perſon has ſtill a <hi>Subſiſtence,</hi> till Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption put on Incorruption; till which time, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature loſeth not its Sinfulneſs, but its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man that I am!</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul.</hi> On this account, the ſtate of the Perſon may be changed, but corrupt Nature ſtill remains.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, The natural Seed of every ſin is a departure from God, and a violation of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore he that is guilty of one Sin vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Authority of God, and has a <hi>ſeminal Guilt</hi> of all Sin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10, 11. As he who has one true Grace has the Seed of all, becauſe it ſhews he is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, and one with him in Spirit, who is the Fountain of all Grace. So that where-ever we ſee Sin, we ſee the Corruption and Pollution of our Nature that dwelleth in us.</p>
            <p>Natural Conſcience, Education, Conſtitution, Profeſſion of Religion, Moral Conſiderations of Fear, Shame, or the like, may curb the working of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in ſome meaſure, but cannot extinguiſh the Pollution of Sin from the heart.</p>
            <p>But more <hi>particularly, in reference to God.</hi> Is there not great Ignorance and Contempt of him? Are not Sins of thoughts more ſlighted than Sins viſible? And is there not more Shame for a ſmall Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the ſight of Man, than great Miſcarriages in the ſight of God? What cuſtomary Ignorance of all his Attributes? How little is he the Object of the Heart's Love, Deſire, Eſteem, and Meditation? Is not the Heart more intent on other things? How little is he the Motive and End of what we do? Is ſerving and pleaſing him the Hearts deſign in all things? In Worſhip, is not the Heart formal, cold, and wandring? Are not Convictions ſtifled, and the Impreſſions of the Word of God quickly gone? Is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:109216:120"/> there ſerious Preparation for the Ordinances, and due Meditation afterwards? Is the Heart glad when the Word reproves, as well as when it hears words of comfort?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for Men:</hi> Is not the Courſe of the World, the Opinion of others, and their Eſteem of great value? Are their ſins my burthen? Is there not Envy, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, want of Sympathy? evil Surmiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for my own Soul:</hi> Is not my heart raſh, vain, inconſiderate; my Underſtanding dark, my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions looſe and ſcattered, and Memory ſlippery, and all out of order?</p>
            <p>Do you not diſcern the <hi>weakning Nature</hi> of Sin, that it ſucks the ſtrength of the Soul, the <hi>deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of it; the <hi>deadning, blinding,</hi> and <hi>deſtructive nature</hi> of it, and the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>divine Wrath</hi> that attends it?</p>
            <p>And now doth all this make thee <hi>(O my Soul!)</hi> cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am;</hi> and doth it make thee a burthen to thy ſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 20. as <hi>Job</hi> cried out? Doſt thou ſee a bottomleſs Deceipt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in thy Nature, as it is in its ſelf corrupted, and by Circumſtances aggravated? And being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Refugeleſs, Doſt thou lay the Hope of thy Help upon a mighty Redeemer? If ſo, thou haſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one <hi>Round</hi> (at leaſt) of that <hi>bleſſed Ladder</hi> which leads thee up to the Fruition of that renewed State, in which thou art God's, and he is thine? <hi>Job</hi> 33. 23, to 31. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 38.</p>
            <p>III. In laying hold on Chriſt for Redemption.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do I ſee I cannot help my ſelf, nor any other Creature help me, <hi>Iſa. 59. 16. Pſal. 49. 7. that none can redeem his Brother, nor give to God a Ranſom for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:109216:120"/>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Salvation</hi> is only of God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. his Arm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That in free Mercy he ſent Chriſt to ſave, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Chriſt undertook this Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. and performed it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That I am partaker of it by meer faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Do I lay my whole weight upon this Saviour? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 8.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Doth my heart account him willing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. able, faithful? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 24.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Do I rejoyce in hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. and praiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. on this account?</p>
            <p>IV. Upon this Relief by Chriſt; Do I yet go farther (as <hi>Eſther</hi> did, to execute the Children of <hi>Haman</hi> after he was dead) yea, to ſee the power of the Prince of this World broken in me? What is the temper and employment of a redeemed Soul, in his juſtified and renewed ſtate? It is to ſhew forth the vertue of him who hath called us from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light; from Sin and Bondage, to Freedom, Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 75. And Oh, that this might be and appear in my Soul. TO THAT END, let my heart ſuffer, and attend to ſome Queſtions concerning this; whereby I may further know that I am the Lords, and not my own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do I account Chriſt only to be the Fountain, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Renewing and Holineſs;</hi> and ſo caſt my ſelf by Faith on him for it, as well as for Pardon; ſeeing I cannot <hi>think</hi> a <hi>thought,</hi> nor <hi>will,</hi> nor <hi>do</hi> any good thing of my ſelf, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 5. Phil.</hi> 2. 13. being created in Chriſt thereto, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. and quickned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by him.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Is the Communion of the Father and the Son,</hi> in a way of light and leading by his Spirit, the <hi>Element I breath in;</hi> ſo that Holineſs is my Choice, and ſweet delight? <hi>Rom. 7. 22. Phil. 3. 10, &amp;c.</hi> and 20. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>In matters of Worſhip: <hi>Do I aim to converſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with God himſelf,</hi> as having to do with his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 17. acting therein <hi>to him?</hi> Col. 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do I labour to ſuck ſanctified Light, and real Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of the Ordinances,</hi> Pſal. 36. 8. which is the Fatneſs of God's Houſe, and tends to make the new Creature flouriſh? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do I bow down and comply with every Word of God; ſubmitting and aſſenting to its full ſcope?</hi> Pſal. 119. 127, 128.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do I rowl my eye towards God; eyeing his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Providence in natural things,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. <hi>and in things that providenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally come to paſs?</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 6. 2 Tim. 4. 17. Act. 12. 23. This is to walk with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do I plot which way I may advance the Intereſt of Chriſt and his Goſpel, in the Capacity in which he hath ſet me,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 15, 19, 23. and to prevent the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of it? 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 12. Tit.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do I conſider whether I go forward or backward in the Trade of Holineſs?</hi> Heb. 5. 12. Whether there

            <p>In theſe, and ſuch like things, the mutual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God and a Regenerate Perſon do ſhine forth: They are tokens that God dwelleth there, and he in God. Such an one is in a new State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has betook himſelf to the <hi>Laws, Company</hi> and <hi>Mode</hi> of the new Creation, created of God in Chriſt, tranſlated to a ſtate of Life in God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A Chriſtian's renewed State obliges him to glorifie God in Body and Spirit; and he doth ſo, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN the Soul doth acknowledge God to be that which he is in himſelf, <hi>Rom. 11. 36. Of him, and through him, and to him are all things; to him be Glory for ever and ever, Amen:</hi> That he is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent in his Nature, and in his Works, and in his Soveraignty, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHEN God is acknowledged to be that which he is to us in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18, 19. and 34. 6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and glorified through Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30, 31. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHEN the Spirit of a Man within him, and the outward Man alſo (concurring according to his Capacity) do act towards God, in an inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with, and actual demonſtration of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature, Will, and Grace of God: Which is called a <hi>walking worthy of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 12. Col. 1. 10. that is to ſay, conformable to him, as the word (<hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>) ſeems to import; comparing <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4. and (as it were) bearing his very Image; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manifeſting what God is to us, and what we are to him; <hi>viz.</hi> that God is ours, and we are his. Now this acting towards God has great variety of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in Believers; for a <hi>Believer</hi> is the <hi>Temple</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:109216:122"/> of God, in which his Glory is more excellently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played than in all the World beſides.</p>
            <p>A BELIEVER, by his peculiar nearneſs to, and intereſt in God, is capacitated, as a <hi>living</hi> and <hi>active Agent,</hi> to glorifie God (1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5, 9. Levit.</hi> 10. 3.) more than another who is only paſſive; as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 17. So then, he who is not his own, but the Lords, and the Lord is his; <hi>his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Element is, to be glorifying of God in all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. as <hi>appears</hi> in theſe and the like Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To reverence and adore the Majeſty of God in all his holy Attributes and Works, as <hi>Neh. 9. 6. Jer. 32. 17, 18, 19. Dan. 9. 4, &amp;c.</hi> and as <hi>David,</hi> and all the people of God were wont to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To be abaſed before God, in the ſence of our Diſproportionableneſs and Corruption; as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen. 18. 27. Jacob, Gen. 32. 10. Ezra. 9. 15. Dan.</hi> 9. 7. did.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To juſtifie God in all his dealings, <hi>Job 36. 3. Pſal.</hi> 51. 4. as <hi>Daniel, c. 9. v.</hi> 4. with Confeſſion, and imploring his Mercy, <hi>Joſhua 7. 19. Dan.</hi> 9. 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To honour the Father in the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. and through him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To own God in Chriſt as the Fountain of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. and every good and perfect Gift, <hi>Jam. 1. 17. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 11. and the Eſtabliſher and Perfecter of it, <hi>Matth. 6. 13. Thine is the kingdom, power und glory, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. To adore him in his Word, 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 18. Iſa. 39. 8. Pſal.</hi> 56. 4. and 119. 106. believing it: To worſhip him with Reverence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 6. and 99. 9. and to own him in his people, <hi>Gal. 1. 24. Matth.</hi> 10. 24. and them for his ſake.</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:109216:122"/>
            <p n="7">7. To abound with the gracious Fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Joh. 15. 8. Phil.</hi> 1. 11. which are by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To confeſs Chriſt before Men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 33. ſuffering reproach, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. and death for his ſake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 19.</p>
            <p>And now, Oh, that God would lead my heart through all theſe things by an <hi>impartial Search,</hi> and cauſe me to compare my preſent frame of heart and Reſolutions with theſe particular Truths of his own Word, and bring me up to glorifie him in my Body and Spirit, which I truſt are his.</p>
            <p>Let me yet farther demand of my ſelf a few Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, which relate to the glorifying of God <hi>in my Soul,</hi> and <hi>in my Walk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it ſo with me, that I cannot be quiet; but reſtleſs under guilt, and diſtance from God? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3, 4, 5. Do I cry, <hi>Return, O Lord,</hi> Iſa. 63. 17. why art thou a Stranger? <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do I hanker after more Heart-impreſſions of the Knowledge of God? <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18. and 34. 6. (<hi>Shew me thy Glory.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is the whole <hi>Will</hi> of God my <hi>delight,</hi> and his <hi>Word</hi> my <hi>daily Diet?</hi> Jer. 15. 16. Job 23. 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do I praiſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23.) and acknowledge God in daily Providences; <hi>Gen. 48. 15. Prov.</hi> 3. 6. not repining at his Diſcipline, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 75. but brought nearer to him by Calamities? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. 7.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do I own him ſo, that the hiding of his face doth darken all other comforts to me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 2. and his preſence ſupport and ſatisfie in the abſence of earthly comforts; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 5. as it was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> at <hi>Ziglag? 1 Sam.</hi> 30. 6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Do I ſo approve my ſelf to God, that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Eſteem, or Praiſe of Man doth rather <hi>vex</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:109216:123"/> than <hi>pleaſe</hi> me when my Conſcience within me doth ſmite me? 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 18. Rom.</hi> 2. 29.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In caſe of guilt and fear, Do I caſt my ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the boundleſs Mercy of God, declared in Chriſt to be pardoned, purged and revived, as a ſufficient Remedy? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Do I hanker after pure Communion with God, ſo that my heart pants out, <hi>Oh that my ways were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</hi> &amp;c. Pſ. 119. 5. Cant. 8. 1. <hi>Oh, Oh?</hi> Pſ. 38. 9.</p>
            <p>THESE and ſuch like workings do teſtifie that God is the <hi>higheſt Good,</hi> and the <hi>Centre</hi> of <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> and infinitely glorious. And in theſe ſpiritual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the Soul doth declare and witneſs him to be ſo; and therein do evidence that God is his, and he is Gods, and hereby is highly privileged; God will not take things at the worſt with him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 40, 41. When ſuch an one is at a loſs, Mercy will ſurprize, and Deliverance overtake him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 11. when dull, his Ears ſhall be awakened to hear as the Learned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 4. he ſhall be kept night and day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. Chriſt will trim and dreſs him by the Word, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. and he will earn towards him, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 15. and be with him in trouble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and God will not be aſhamed to be called his God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. he will wipe away his Tears, teach him by his Spirit, pardon his Sins, juſtifie his Perſon in the Perſon of Chriſt, and confeſs him to be his at the laſt day; where he ſhall ſee his face with joy, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 26. and ever be with the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17.</p>

                  <head>A <hi>CONFLICT</hi> of Mind.</head>
                  <p>HOw ſoon did <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> forget the glorious <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> and fell aſleep when the Temptation came? How ſoon is Sight gone, when the Sun is eclipſed? So it is with me. When ſhall I have skill to diſcern and reſiſt the beginnings of Decay? How ſoon doth a Troop of Armed Men break in at an unguarded Gap? I cannot thruſt them out again my ſelf; but will rather go to him who hath his Bridle in their Jaws, and can both turn them back, and alſo lock the Door againſt them. Oh, that I could lift up a <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s Cry to the Lord of Hoſts! Then would the day clear up, and I ſhould yet ſee my Salvation come, flying upon the Wings of the Wind, and mounted upon the Glouds for my help. I have one hard task to do: but, O thou, to whom nothing is hard! reveal thy Will, and conquer mine. My ſore Task and Travel is this; How to retain a cloſe Application of Union with God in Chriſt, ſo as that I may prevent the loſs of tender Converſe, and holy reverential Familiarity
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:109216:124"/> and Intercourſe with him. An immoderate mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſomewhat, in it ſelf (for ought I can yet ſee) not unlawful, has been a thorn in my fleſh for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, which has ſpent much venom againſt my inward Man; but I muſt not ſuccumb to any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary: there is no ſafety but in overcoming. Help me throughly, O my God, at this plunge, and thou ſhalt have the honour of the day. I would fain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into my Soul, how I contracted this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and upon enquiry, I find it had ſuch ſteps as theſe:</p>
                  <p>I was withdrawn, I know not how, from the tender ſight of Chriſt: and influences of ſpiritual Warmth being damp'd, Night came upon me, and I conſidered it not: my Soul fell aſleep, but without any Refreſhment: I awaked a little now and then, but Slumber benummed me, that I could not riſe up: I would fain cry out for help, but my words were like an Arrow without Feathers, that would not reach the Mark: and all this while an earthly and momentany matter of delight ſolicited my fancy, aad proffered ſome pleaſure to my mind; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I judged it not materially evil, I gave way, till it had eaten into my Soul like a Canker, and began to build its Neſt in the very place, which I had lately prepared and devoted for the Entertainment of Chriſt only. It was reſtleſs, and would not yield to <hi>Chriſt's Supremacy</hi> in my Affections, but ſtill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſome Moon-light Satisfaction to my Mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of the withdrawn Beams of the Sun: and when Chriſt whiſpered ſome Conviction into my heart, and made it ake, and raiſed ſome ſmall yernings after him, this Glo-worm gliſtered upon me; and though it had neither light nor heat, yet it would pretend a competent Ballance, inſtead of the true ſpiritual
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109216:124"/> light and warmth which I lately had, but now found it was retired at a diſtance from me, for my trial and exerciſe. I diſcerned the Snare, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lay my Strait: My Judgment told me, the <hi>matter</hi> it ſelf was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and that a moderate diligence might be employed about it; but neither that, nor any thing elſe muſt dethrone Chriſt from the chief Seat in my Affections: but I found it had ſo twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into my fancy, that I knew not how to uſe my thoughts about, it with that moderation as would conſiſt, with <hi>Chriſt's ſupream Government</hi> and <hi>Sway</hi> in my inmoſt delight and affections. So that, how to divide between the matter it ſelf, and my exceſſive affection to it; to do the one, and guard againſt the other; here lies the difficulty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>matter</hi> on which this inordinate fancy fed it ſelf was, ſomething relating to LITERATURE; which I judged, in its own nature, lawful and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. To remedy which diſtemper, I poured out my complaint before the Lord, and began to muſe the following Meditations.</p>

That bleſſed word began the ſecond Creation, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced Carnal Senſe, and the way of its Reaſon, and brought in the Draft of a new created State, in which the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is renewed upon the Soul; ſwaying it by ſpiritual Knowledge and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, into a ſtate of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; and has given it Dominion, by a holy Force, and rightful Power, to ſubject all Humane Senſe and Reaſon, Knowledge, Underſtanding, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights thereof, to the Authority and full Command of the Wiſdom of the Spirit. And therefore I would wait for ſome Dew from this Wiſdom that is from above, to water and guide me: and by this Conduct I would lay down theſe <hi>Grounds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The purſuit of a lawful thing is ſo far ſinful to me,</hi> as the purſuit thereof doth tend to diſtract my <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Converſe</hi> with God, and <hi>that</hi> which makes the Mind of Chriſt, in his Word and Godly Conference, unreliſhable to me. <hi>That</hi> which tends to contract and confine my view of the Worth of Chriſt, my neceſſity of him, and relation to him. <hi>That</hi> which hinders me from a penitent and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous watchfulneſs and reluctancy, againſt the defiling nature of my Heart-corruptions. <hi>That</hi> which wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the exerciſe of my faith, about the reality of Divine Truths; God's all-ſeeing Eye, the conſtant neceſſity of Holineſs in my heart, and in my aim; unlimited and free Reſignation to the Will of God, and a hungry expectation of the appearing of Chriſt, and my own Diſſolution. <hi>That</hi> which offers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to all or any Chriſtian Duty, which takes off my deſire to the Ordinances and profitable uſe of them, as if the time were loſt which is ſpent in ſuch work. <hi>That</hi> which cares not for an Exerciſe of Faith
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109216:125"/> and Prayer for a bleſſing upon it, and direction and aſſiſtance from God in it, doth declare it ſelf ſo far to be a Work of the Fleſh, and not wrought in God. For if I am wholly redeemed, then nothing in me is to be any longer at my natural Command; but my whole ſelf, and all my ways and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do come under the Laws of the Spirit of Life which is in Chriſt. In all which forementioned Particulars, I have found Guilt ſliding in upon me with a ſtrong hand.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, I would conſider <hi>what</hi> civil Actions, Labours, or Studies may be truly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lawful, and within that Command and Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the fourth Commandment; <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labonr, and do all that thou haſt to do;</hi> viz. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi> may conduce to adminiſter any true natural good to the Body, Eſtate, or Credit of my ſelf or others, which lies included in all the Precepts of the ſecond Table, <hi>Exod. 20. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, &amp;c. Whatſoever</hi> may conduce to poliſh true Reaſon, and free the diſcerning faculty of the Mind, from that Captivity, Darkneſs and Infirmity, contracted by the Fall of our firſt Parents; which diſabled the Underſtanding, in a great meaſure, to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things truly morally good and evil; without which, the <hi>diſcourſive faculty</hi> of the Soul cannot act within it ſelf, or be capable of any impreſſions for its good from the words of others; the freeing of which would tend much to make way for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of gracious Convictions where the Word of God is heard, or leave that Soul more wilfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable: which ſeems te be hinted in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 18, 19. where the Prophet ſpeaks of the very irrationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Idol-worſhip,</hi> as that which contradicts the true uſe even of natural Reaſon.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109216:126"/> 
                     <hi>Whatſoever</hi> may help Reaſon in its Exerciſe; as Conference with, and reading the Labours of ſuch whom God hath fitted, in any meaſure, for repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſad Breach made on Humane Nature. And <hi>whatſoever</hi> may conduce for the help of <hi>Memory;</hi> as the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Writing:</hi> which Art we find juſtified in the Scriptures, <hi>Dan. 9. 2. Deut. 6. 9. Whatſoever</hi> may make the Offices of <hi>Humanity</hi> (as well as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) more communicable; as the knowledge of Tongues: the ordinary learning of which ſeems to be juſtified by the extraordinary Gift of Tongues, whereby the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were enabled to diſpenſe the Goſpel in the World. <hi>Whatſoever</hi> alſo may tend to the underſtanding of the Letter of the Scriptures; as the Knowledge eſpecially, of the Original Tongues.

                  <p>Having weighed the lawfulneſs of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Particulars, among which, one of thoſe Caſes do (at preſent, more than the reſt) concern my own Conſideration, and further Enquiry; and therefore I would next conſider how a natural, or civil lawful Action may be done lawfully: ſo as not to prejudice the inward Man, by grieving the Spirit in the manner of a Man's labour, care, pains, diligence, or ſtudy; or in his utmoſt end and deſign therein. A right <hi>ſpiritual End</hi> in <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral Actions</hi> lies in theſe reſpects:</p>

               <p>YOur Letter I very gladly received; and 'tis no ſmall delight to me, to ſee that your eyes are towards Heaven, and your deſires to the fear of your Maker. Before I was hopeful, but now I am confident. And being the beautiful Light of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath enlightned your Soul, and purified your Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God: ſeeing 'tis thus, fear not, only be ſtrong. Be thrifty of your time, exact in your courſe, ſpiritual in your aim; bearing about an undaunted Triumph in believing. One thing among the reſt, not unneedful; I muſt adviſe you, that you ſet your ſelf to pluck up your Spirits, and be of a lively heart, getting what neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the World you can; that you may the better get within the humours of all people, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the better how to carry your ſelf, in what condition of life ſoever you ſhall be in, to your own comfort, and the ſhunning of unneceſſary Reproach or Contempt; but contrarily, Credit and Eſteem of all, even of them that are without. The Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109216:128"/> of Worldly Wiſdom, Policy, Skill, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavour muſt be uſed, albeit not depended on, nor the Corruptions of the World practiſed. Something I do the rather write this way, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſome other Courſe of Life will befall you ere long than at preſent you are in; yet ſtill keep cloſe to Almighty God: and whereas others in their Courſe on Earth, and creditable Converſation here, do ſacrifice to their Wits, Boldneſs, Contrivance, and the like; do you endeavour and pray that you may ſacrifice to the Will, Wiſdom, and Aſſiſtance of God in Heaven, made over to you in the Merits of Chriſt undoubtedly. The Lord be with us, and grant us unearthly Hearts and Converſations, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may hereafter betide us. There is no Rock like our Rock, no God like our God: to him I commit my ſelf and you, for an everlaſting Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>

               <p>HAving ſuch an opportunity, I could not but write you a few Lines: and all that I have to ſay is; Caſt your ſelf upon God in Jeſus Chriſt: Eat his Fleſh, and drink his Bloud: Be with him upon the Croſs, be with him aſcended into Heaven; by the one to be diſcharged from the Clamours of the Law, and the Guiltineſs of Conſcience; by the other to triumph in Aſſurance of Victory over Sin and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. This Implanting into the Son is by Faith: this Life of Faith is fed by Meditation of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, with Prayer, and attentive Reading and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with good Conference with experienced Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Uſe of the Sacraments. Theſe things I
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109216:129"/> believe your heart doth ponder; but we are bound to put one another in mind. And next, ſeek and ſtrive in your Service to be laborious, faithful, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet; ſeparate not the Service of Chriſt from the Service of your Maſter; ſerve one in the other; ſtrive mightily to temper them well one with the other; and then, what you put your hand unto, do it with all your might, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Know you are under great Suffering, and what word of Comfort or Counſel to write to you I know not, only this, that it is of the Lord; as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was not to be angry, you are not to be tortured with Grief. That one, that two Gourds are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together: Morality and Reaſon do plead for Patience and Content, but your intereſt in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Heir of all things may truly argue it much more: He that gave you them at firſt, has now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them away. The Giver lives, though the Gift be withdrawn. The Comforter is the ſame, and the ſubſtance, though the Comfort be removed, and the Leaves fallen. Haply your thoughts are, Where are they? Whither gone? At reſt, or not? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe eye ſaw them before they were formed in the Womb; the everlaſting Decree had diſpoſed of them before they were committed to your hands: leave the thought of them to the Lord, whoſe free Love is like a mighty Deep. And, Oh that the Courſe which the Lord takes to mind us, that the end of all things is at hand, might powerfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge our Hopes, Peace, and Comfort from an Earthly Reſt in low tranſient things, and fix them in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:109216:129"/> him who is the <hi>Rock of Ages;</hi> which we are called to do upon every hand: I truſt that out-ſtretched Hand of his will do it; that at length we may know no perſons according to the Fleſh, nor things neither. Then alone in enjoying the Lord, ſhall you and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy our ſelves, and the reality of every good thing when the ſhadows flee away. Is not your Father better than ten Sons, and his teaching Rod than their preſence, conſider it? Enquire his Will, bleſs his Name, comfort your poor Wife, and do not charge God folliſhly. Seek God's Face the more, and let your Converſation mount higher, and then your loſs will be repayed, and God will ſhew you his intent in this. This only, as a Fellow-feeler of your Croſs, I preſent unto you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>COnſidering mine own weakneſs, and remembring you are in the ſame Body; and withall, conſidering that mutual Communications (by Pen or Speech) is required to help each other, and ſtir up one another to the reliſh and practice of Chriſtian Walking, I thought fit (in meer diſcharge of duty) to repreſent my preſent thoughts to you. And that I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare more diſtinctly the ſtate of my Soul to you, I paſs by the general Complainings and Bewailings which oftentimes ariſe from pretended religious Complement, or carnal Sloth; to a more particular Account.</p>
               <p>I find the Reputation of the World doth much beguile me; eſpecially when I have to do with Men neither groſly wicked, nor ſtrictly good. And I find Intimacy with theſe Men, and in their Actions
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109216:130"/> of Indifferency, do plague my Soul with ſuch cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, drineſs and guilt, that (methinks) ſometimes I part from them, as <hi>Tamar</hi> from <hi>Amnon,</hi> full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhame and diſquiet. Let me at any time go out of God's ſight to act things, though indifferent in their nature, yet when Conſcience calls for any ſpiritual duty or diſcourſe, methinks 'tis like the voice that came to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Cool of the Day. I find alſo a ſtrange influence upon my heart from the ways of coveting any worldly Advantage. Well was this wickedneſs called Idolatry; for it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately draw my ear, and draw my eye and heart from the Lord, to admire and covet after vain Enjoyments; and yet I cannot ſay that to this day I ever wanted any good thing. This I find to be both a deceiving and unprofitable Luſt, ſpoiling the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my Soul, and not enriching my Body, nor ever adding one Cubit to my Stature. Nothing doth ever make the thought of any miſery miſerable to me, but the reflections of a betrayed heart; and they ſtare upon me, as <hi>Delilah</hi> did on <hi>Sampſon</hi> when his ſtrength was gone, and the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> were upon him; and then my Soul is as weak as Water. But ſhould I go to number up the Deceits that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, they are innumerable? only 'tis ſome eaſe, now and then, to open the Impoſthume, as to God, ſo alſo to good Men. I know not how far your ſenſe of the ſame, or other infirmities may oppreſs you, but I know you wear about with you the ſame Nature as I do, though, I hope, more enabled to ſtrive againſt the Stream of Nature than I am: but whatever ſtrength you have, I am ſure it comes from above; and indeed I muſt needs ſay, and my heart rejoyceth at the mention, that I am not forſaken in this Conflict; my Redeemer is ſtrong, and mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:109216:130"/> are judged already, and ſhall not afflict me for ever. I am directed to a ſure Remedy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 3, 4, 5. and ſhall lay it before you (if your diſeaſe be mine) <hi>viz.</hi> to truſt in the Lord in well doing only; <hi>Delight in the Lord, and commit your way to him:</hi> let this <hi>Phyſick</hi> have its true work, and the Truth of God is engaged for a Recovery. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I am (as it were) venturing on ſuch a Reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this <hi>Truſting, Delighting,</hi> and <hi>Committing</hi> doth ſignifie; and (methinks) the very Reſolution ſo to do, as a Beam of God's Power and Love, doth rejoyce my heart in hope. Doubtleſs it is a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life to give up all our delight, our truſt, and commit all our way unto the Lord: and doubtleſs, that is the way to fight againſt our Luſts with much advantage, when we are got above them; and in our Reſignment to God, have engaged him in the Quarrel. I know the advantage is very great, by ſome little ſparks of it. And I never knew that I got power againſt one Luſt of heart, or evil way, but by being firſt (as it were) diſſolved into the Lord, and then appearing againſt it in his power. When God and I am made one through Chriſt, in oppoſition to my own ſins, and am no longer mine own, but his, and my faith acting through this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then I muſt, yea, and I may ſay, Doth the ſtrength and ſnares of Temptation vaniſh at his appearing; And happy is that Soul that appears in no other ſtrength but his. But while I am writing, my heart doth accuſe my Pen, for hinting an Enjoyment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what I have. I can only ſay this; ſomething of this I have already taſted, and more I earneſtly hope for, as the only Remedy for a weak, captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, diſmayed heart. I pray, let me hear how it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with you; that we may in the Lord, help one
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:109216:131"/> another, and build up one another in the moſt holy Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Hope there is a Power within you that will never leave purging, healing, convincing, teaching, and delivering of you, till you can ſay, the Powers, the Employments, the Labours of this preſent World are the Lords and his Chriſts; that God is all in all to you and in you. Herein lies our Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt all unworthy undervaluings of our Intereſt, goings forth in our own Strength or Wiſdom, Carnal Damps of our Zeal, coolings of our Intimacy with God, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Creature; and ſo being courted of the Devil in the Creature, till many times our Warmth is gone, our Locks cut, our Strength and Comfort departed together; and then the poor Soul looks
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:109216:131"/> upon his Corruption, and all the Engines of his Back-ſliding, as <hi>Amnon</hi> did on his deflowred Siſter; <hi>Have her out of my ſight.</hi> Then the Soul lies as weak as any other; in an equal Line to the Men of this World; but God only, who raiſeth the Dead for his free Grace, and eternal Covenant of Love, recovers this loſs again, reſtores health to the heart, and makes the Soul ſay, <hi>I was dead, but am alive.</hi> That a Vein of Life, and Beam of Light ſhould run through ſo many Eclipſes, and yet live, and not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be deſtroyed; this is the work of the Lord, and it is marvellous in our eyes. As there is no Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the World that is uſeful for common Good, but hath its Foundation in the Wiſdom, Pity, and Care of God towards his poor Creatures, ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſame of yours: and my deſire to God for you is, that you may uſe your Calling only as under his eye, and in the wiſdom and fear of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>YOur friendly and Chriſtian Lines I received, and do with you rejoyce in the happineſs of your neareſt Relation. The happineſs is the greater, in that your Principles do accord, as well as your Affections; which renders your Condition a more lively Type of the Conjugal Intereſt betwixt Chriſt and a Believer. You ſay, your experience tells you it is good to wait on God: do not forget the ſame experience in other caſes. Abound in ſpiritual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to one another as much as you can, and in ingenuous Marriage-Love, and Affections alſo; but beware of that which is inordinate; remembring that they that marry are to be as if they married not,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:109216:132"/> 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29, &amp;c.</hi> It may be you may find new Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations in your new Condition, and God teaching you thereby: If ſo, there is ſtill cauſe of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for God has many ways, in variety of Trials, to teach, to purge, and comfort. I perceive there is that within you which takes little content in high Speculations without Power: I think it is no ſmall happineſs to be preſerved from the vain unſavoury Profeſſion of the times, conſiſting more in <hi>Phraſe of Words, Humane Wit, and Pride, than Power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Doubtleſs, the ancient Path of Sincerity, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Patience, Love, and Fruits of Thankfulneſs is the beſt Path for Saints to travel in; waiting on God for more enlarged hearts, and enlightned eyes, both to know and do his Will with the more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. Ah! the Purity and Spiritualneſs of the <hi>Apoſtles Writings,</hi> and the <hi>Sermons</hi> of <hi>Chriſt!</hi> There is no cavelling, jeering; but Bowels of Tenderneſs, and awful, ſweet Reverence in the things of God. Let your thoughts ſtill fix there; aſſociate with the moſt Tender and Sincere, and you ſhall eſcape the deſtructive Influence of that (ſeeming religious) looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Atheiſm, which has (I doubt) cankered many a hopeful Profeſſor. As for my own part, I tumble to and fro under Temptations, yet reaping this fruit thereby, to thirſt the more after the day of Chriſt's Appearance, and my Deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>GOd has been pleaſed to put us, and continue us long aſunder, and we have had our variety of Troubles, Dangers and Temptations; and in regard we can come no nearer each other, let us ſpeak at a diſtance. By the view I have made of earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and earthly conditions, I can ſay with my whole heart, <hi>The beſt Refreſhment is vexation of Spirit:</hi> and if ſo, then comes this rebuke; How have I laid out my Money for that which is not Bread? God has delivered me from being a burthen to my Friends, and yet my Body and Soul (Ah, when will it once be!) is not given up as a Sacrifice to him only.</p>
               <p>Brother, I perceive ſo much of the unſearchable pity of the Lord to me, that I know not what to do or ſay. Oh, that my heart might break into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pieces, and be made up again by the Spirit of Renewing! What a miſery is it to deſire that might live, which is nailed to the Croſs, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied! Oh, for the Newneſs of the Spirit, to ſee the new Creature, that old things might paſs away from one end of the Soul unto the other. I tremble at the mention of theſe words, becauſe the Power is of God; and the dark deſign of the Luſt within me
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:109216:133"/> labours to deſtroy my Intereſt, ruine my Peace, and make me unſerviceable to my God, to whom I am going. Oh, that I could in the power of my dear Saviour, raiſe my head ſo high out of the miſery that eaſily beſets me, as to peep forth into the freſh Air of a whole Reſignment, even of what I have, am, or do expect, unto God through Chriſt, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and unreſervedly! You are on my heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that you may be ſaved from your ſelf and World, from your fears, comforts and hopes; that the Kingdom of our dear Lord exalt it ſelf exceedingly in your heart. The Lord himſelf be your Guide; to whom alone I can adventure to ſurrender you. I am again returning from my Wives Grave, into—to ſeek mine own, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>DEar Siſter, I account it my duty to hold up an Intercourſe of writing to you, as opportunity and time will permit; as being ſenſible, in ſome meaſure, of the ſtate of your inward Man. My words have no quickning life; the bodily preſence of Chriſt himſelf could not do it without the Spirit, much leſs the Pen of a ſinful Worm, but I will ſend you where this Ware is to be ſold at a cheap rate, if Complements of Self-preparedneſs (for I can call it no other) do not hinder, Iſa. 55. 1. <hi>Buy Wine and Milk without Money:</hi> ſay it over again, <hi>without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> What, is this the voice of your Beloved; <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price?</hi> Is it indeed without price? How hard is this one Leſſon, without price? My Guilt can preſs me down; but can it preſs him down who bears up Heaven and Earth? Can my weakneſs hinder me
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:109216:133"/> from lying down? There is nothing more acceptable to him, as for me to lie down upon him; you can never lean too hard upon your well Beloved. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing troubles him, but when you lean from him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 5. This is true Goſpel-venture: Hence comes quickning in God's ſweet ſeaſon of God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. How eaſie, think you, it were for you to come to Chriſt if you were without ſpot? But are you not aſhamed to let Chriſt waſh you from all your ſins? You are loath to trouble him ſo far, and yet you can never pleaſe him better. The greater the work of his Redemption, the greater is his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This rather wins his heart to you, than render you unpleaſing or unwelcome to him; 'Tis his own bewailing Language, <hi>Ye will not come to me,</hi> &amp;c. If you will look up to the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> you will quickly know Freedom. There is no condition you can be in, but you are well enough, if Chriſt be with you. That's the reaſon that neither Water nor Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can deſtroy: he is willing; be you ſo too. Truſt him, and ſee if any condition whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes ſhort of Remedy, where <hi>Chriſt is all in all;</hi> all for Pardon, all for Purging, all for Advice, Reſt and Satisfaction.

               <p>GOd has hitherto ſpun out my worldly Being, and continued Life. My main labour (as faſt as I can turn other buſineſs and thoughts out of doors) is to ſeek the Lord by <hi>ſpiritual Enquiry:</hi> one hour of cloſe Communion with him is better than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. A little I taſte by Glimpſes and Glances of that Taſte; but, I bleſs his Name, I thirſt for more. Sometimes my Condition is nothing but almoſt a very Darkneſs; but my God doth then rouſe up a poor dead heart, and enlighten it again by and by. Oh the Riches of that Goodneſs that doth ſo often gird us, when we know not he is ſo near! Such a Saviour who is a living <hi>Pillar of Atonement,</hi> and his Nature, through Sufferings, the very <hi>Seat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:109216:134"/> for all that come to God by him: our Lord, our Lord Chriſt; whoſe Sufferings were not for his own ſake, and from whom a longing Soul was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repulſed. But Oh, methinks ſometimes the Wonder is too great to be the Lot of ſuch a poor Wretch; but a better thought again tells me that this is the very differencing mark of <hi>Goſpel-faith,</hi> not to come with a full hand of Righteouſneſs, and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Preparedneſs; but with a hand and heart fully guilty, through the Fleſh, of all manner of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Contradiction againſt the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt, and lay ſuch a heart and hand before him, and beg his help to cure that <hi>Enmity,</hi> and ſtop the mouth of that <hi>Contradiction,</hi> and cauſe the poor Soul by believing, to triumph ſingly in his Conqueſt; which doth then moſt ſingly appear to the eye of Faith, when a ſick Soul lays the whole weight of his Diſeaſes upon Chriſt, and not touch the bearing of the Guilt of one of them, nor endeavour to eaſe the Shoulder of Chriſt by one of his fingers. Chriſt neither needs nor deſires ſuch help at a Sinner's hand: His work is to tread the Wine-preſs alone; thine and mine (dear Siſter) is only to believe, and ſee his Salvation. Let us not raſhly or impatiently put our hand to the Ark, as <hi>Uzza</hi> did; but leave him the whole honour of his own Croſs: only wait humbly and believingly in the uſe of Prayer, and pondering the Scriptures; for there the Spirit appears, to form the Soul into a ſafe and Goſpel-reſt, and create the Image of Chriſt, and will renew by degrees, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of his Grace, ſuch a Soul.</p>

               <p>YOur long, large, and ſavoury Letter I received; I diſcern your thirſt in thoſe Lines, you are not alone in that Agony.

I could write many complaining Lines; yea, I can never complain too much of my vile ſinful Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, but in doing that, I muſt not blemiſh the free Grace of God in Chriſt; yea, I am ſorry I have done it too much wrong hitherto. Devils are againſt it, Fleſh and Blood are againſt it; and ſhall I do ſo too? Let me embrace it rather; never mourning from God, but mourning towards him, in hope, above hope. Study that word, <hi>Yield not to wearineſs, nor faintneſs in mind at no hand; through faith and patience you ſhall inherit it, as well as the reſt of</hi> Abraham's <hi>Daughters before you.</hi> Was not Chriſt in an Agony?

               <p>THe Conveniency of this Opportunity provoketh me to write to you by this Bearer, who has promiſed to ſee my Child. I deſire that as ſhe grows in capacity, you would be dropping in ſomewhat of ſpiritual things for her tender thoughts to feed upon. Though I cannot at this diſtance ſee your face, yet I know your Temptations in ſome part, and your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; which will in due time appear. 'Tis good to be carried about, and diſpoſed by the hand of the Lord: 'tis a bleſſed thing, and will one day appear ſo, to rejoyce in the pleaſure of the Lord, let him do with a poor Creature what he will, ſo he make it more like himſelf, by unſelfing you from carnal deſires, and carnal diſcontents and fears, and tranſplanting you into the power and joy of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; accounting really the offer of eternal kindneſs in Chriſt more Glory, than any earthly dying comfort: and certainly where the Comforts here can comfort but little, the Croſſes here can croſs but little; and ſhortly farewel both. Let your heart plod much on the free Covenant of Grace in Chriſt, by Prayer and Meditation; and let your ſins come into the ſame Room with you, while you are on that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. When I am at a dead lift, then ſometimes the Spirit of God takes me up (as it were) into the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:109216:136"/> Arms of that Covenant which he made with Chriſt concerning me, and whoſoever is not a wilful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer. And the very glance of that Salvation wrought by the Lord, concerning which I am only to believe, ſets me again upon my feet. I have no other task but to be willing in truth to receive it, and I ſhall have it: and if ſo, then you and I ſhall be ſure never to want any one good thing. Evil (as Evil from the Lord) cannot befall us. You will then ſee the favour of God to you in earthly ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Frowns. No ſuch favour as to be dead to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Comforts, and as a Stranger to earthly carnal Contents, though this be tedious to Fleſh and Blood; yet let it more appear that our Reſt is not in theſe things, but in the ever-living God: he is your Teacher, and I leave you to him.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:109216:136"/> noted in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37. till the power of the Moſt High doth bear it in. Ah, when will it once be! Certainly that Grace will one day be very glorious, that hath attended a poor diſtreſſed heart, through the uncomfortable ſights, and abundant frailties of this corrupt mortal condition.

               <p>YOu ſee this ſtate here is wavering, unſetled, moving to and fro. 'Tis a wondrous thing to ſee how the Lord is pleaſed to raiſe up one Wave of diſquiet after another, to moleſt the publick Peace, and exerciſe the pains and patience of his people. It is no Miſery, but a Privilege to one that is choſen hence, to be emptied from Veſſel to Veſſel; and indeed, I ſcarce know a greater ſign of <hi>Chriſt's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Love,</hi> than by his Providence to render all other things and Conditions here to be unlovely and undeſirable: for then the Affections have no where elſe to centre but in Chriſt; and that makes them go out ſtrong that way. Albeit my condition ſpeaks much viſible Uncertainty, as to this outward Man, yet I find a mighty War within me, againſt a free and clear Cloſing with the certain Riches of Glory which is in Chriſt, in which notwithſtanding, I truſt I have an Intereſt, and have recieved ſome witneſs thereof, There is a ſecret joy in the inward
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:109216:137"/> part of my Soul, and Refreſhment at the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Promiſes of the God of Truth, my Rock. Sometimes Hope and Deſire brings me near to Chriſt, and he to me. 'Tis an admirable thing to think how a Soul can at the ſame time be covered over with its Guilt, and yet be freed, and triumph over the ſame, as removed in Chriſt, truly, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for ever: yet this is the <hi>Golpel-Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> A Body diſeaſed through Sin, yet a Mind towards the Brazen Serpent, a flying to the Horns of the Altar; and that does the work. Oh the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification through the means of believing (and only plain-hearted believing) is a ſtrange thing, yet not at all difficult where the Anoynting teaches, and the Soul be made free by the Spirit from Carnal Quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Complements; as the poor believing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was, who preſt to touch the Hem of Chriſt's Garment, without IFS and ANDS. The Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all your Paths, and make you fruitful in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through believing, and fear no evil. Fare you well in the Lord for ever.</p>

Be eyeing what the Redeemer has done, what the vertue of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is; not what difficult deſign he attempted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be to honour him the more, who has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:109216:138"/> all that we can ſuppoſe to have moſt difficulty in it. I think it is a matchleſs Mercy to let our ſins of all ſorts and aggravations be caſt on his Croſs, with a humble Reſignment to him; waiting for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Strength, as a penitent Sinner's Portion through Faith. The Lord be with you, in whom I reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>MY dear Friend, I underſtand by what I hear, that you are like to ſtay ſome time in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whilſt I am detained here; and in regard I know your main deſire is, to ſerve Jeſus Chriſt in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, I deſire the place of your abode, and the people you labour amongſt may be adapted to ſuch a ſavoury deſign.

Beware of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; your work is excellent, your labour ſhort, your infirmities undertaken by Chriſt, and your Temptations and the Tempter alſo judged.

               <p>I Truſt you find the Word of God faithful, and creating faithfulneſs alſo (in the Seed thereof) in your heart. I think this is a <hi>true Maxim,</hi> One de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate unfeigned deſire of perfect Righteouſneſs in Chriſt is the very fruit of the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: For who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, but he alone, by his creating Power and Love? Nouriſh Faith tenderly and humbly; try the Lord's Will, and your own heart; prize that Faith which puts forward all Grace, which takes away diſcouragement from Mortification, and makes it as the <hi>Gate of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hope of Glory;</hi> for the Apoſtle found it ſo, and pleads it juſt ſo to us, <hi>Rom. 6. 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;c.</hi> You have a good Guide; give him the honour ſolely, to order your heart and way; his voice is heard in the Scripture. Believe not your own heart, or reaſon againſt the naked word of Truth. In Caſes of Scruple, or diſcouragement of any ſort, give your ſelf the ſame Counſel, as by the Scriptures you would give to another perſon in the ſame Caſe. The work of Faith is not to make ſin no ſin; but becauſe of ſin, to bring the Soul to the Redeemer; that the more ſin it ſees, it may the more abhor it, and triumph the more, in that Grace doth ſuper-abound through a Mediator. And here lies the Myſtery of Faith; the Lord himſelf has it, and you and I ſhall ſay we have enough.</p>

               <p>SInce God made your heart pant after that World, in which dwells Immortality and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did you ever (upon good Grounds) judge any earthly Friend a certain Comfort? If ſo, then has God, by removing your Siſter, and now by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your Father, witneſſed the contrary. If you apprehended them as uncertain, then why are they not ſufficiently repayed in the fatherly reſpect of an unchangeable God? Is it good to be angry with the Lord? Do not ſtudy to be more ſour and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but how to be more holy, ſelf-denying, and chearful, on the account of a freely tendered Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; rejoycing that ſhortly you ſhall take your Journey, and go viſit your Father, your Siſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the Saints ſince the beginning. Never ſtudy how to diſhonour the nature of the Goſpel, by a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len carnal pleading of Self-unworthineſs. The truth is, Self is not worthy to plead, but Chriſt is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be loved and believed; and that's enough. If he will love me, heal me, purge me, ſave me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, accept me freely, why ſhould I be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at it; and ſay, he cannot mean as the Goſpel ſpeaks? My ſullen heart is never broke, till Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Convincement from God break my heart to powder; till that time I play with Melancholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a kind of vexing delight. I truſt God will teach you ſome good Leſſon by this Viſitation, that the knowledge of God in Chriſt, and the knowledge of your heart may be wiſely taken in. I earneſtly deſire this, that all your thoughts be brought over to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the good pleaſure of God with delight, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>that good pleaſure of his,</hi> and be thankful for that; yet
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109216:139"/> you have an opportunity to honour him, by ſaying and thinking all his ways are Mercy and Truth. Though he take to himſelf your neareſt Friends, you do them ſo much right, as to rejoyce that they reign; though you mourn after your Beloved, and long to leave your ſelf, that you may love him the better. I leave you to him, who can and will do more in his love and pity, than I or any Friend can do. Rejoyce in hope, lift up your head, the days of your Lamentation is almoſt ended.

               <p>I Enjoy my health, through the goodneſs of God, as yet. My Soul has many dry and ſapleſs Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, many drowſie and fainty Qualms, through the deceipt of heart that lies rooted within; but yet the Lord cries ever and anon in my ear, <hi>I am God,</hi> and <hi>I change not; therefore thou art not conſumed.</hi> I find it deſperately dangerous to ſet my Reaſon and Senſe in diſpute with that which Faith only ſhould take up, <hi>viz.</hi> Reconcilement upon free Terms. If there be any Sinfulneſs, or any Aggravation of Sin, which ſeems to except it ſelf from the Remedy of <hi>Chriſt's Atonement,</hi> then certainly the Eye of Faith takes not up its Mark as it ſhould do. If there be any Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Darkneſs, and the Soul think to get over it without a humble Reſignation of the Caſe to Chriſt for help, it will find the Cure come badly on. A heart which would not have a liberty for ſinning, can never engage in a free-hearted Adventure on Chriſt too far for Pardon and Strength. Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refuſed any one Sinner that came to him on
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:109216:140"/> Earth, unleſs it were the mocking, treacherous, and ſpightful Phariſees? and therefore I am bound to believe he hears and accepts every unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, though hardneſs and darkneſs do afflict. So that I am (with my lamenting after him) to rejoyce alſo that he is himſelf the Corner-ſtone of that work in my heart that yearns after him in a dry Land.

               <p>I Thought good to ſend you a few Lines, which while I am writing, ſerves inſtead of a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; there only wants your Anſwer to every Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the mutual refreſhing of your Voice. I can at a diſtance gueſs at your thoughts; I can alſo take Refreſhment in this, that the Arm of the Lord, ſeen by you, or unſeen, yet it holds you, teacheth you, and is always near you. We may not think the unchangeable God doth change as oft as we uſe to change. Not every Cloud, nor all the Clouds of the Sky are able to hinder the Courſe of the Sun, becauſe the Sun is above them; and ſo is the <hi>Covenant of our Peace</hi> above our Darkneſs and Weakneſs. A ſmall matter (if Seaſons of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Dulneſs may be called ſo) is enough, when Unbelief is cheriſhed, to make as much miſchief in the Soul, as a Woolf among a Flock of Sheep. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every Sin is hateful in the ſight of God, and a ſluggiſh heart (that is rather prone continually to all that is evil, inwardly and outwardly, than inclined to good) is grievous to the Spirit of God. But this is perpetually the Refuge; that God accounts the Sinfulneſs of his People their Sickneſs, not their
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:109216:140"/> State; and to purge and cure them, he uſeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one Means, and ſometimes another; witneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 31, 32, 33, 34. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 8, 9. But ſtill the Covenant, being wholly of his Contrivement, ſtands fixed in Heaven; and Jeſus Chriſt, who has both your Nature, as much as if your ſelf were there, and God's Nature too in one Perſon; to preſerve that Covenant in your ſtead for your good. There is no creature-goodneſs of any ſort ſoever that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers any perſon to have an Intereſt in that Covenant, becauſe he ſheweth Mercy to whom he will. And there is nothing eſſentially needful to give any one a Right to apply this Covenant, but a ſenſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and a willingneſs to accept it, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it only. As wicked people fancy the way to Heaven ſo as that they think they can obtain it, and yet deſire ſtill to keep their ſins in their Boſoms, and cannot hear of parting with them; ſo many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious people, though beloved of God, cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Eternal Life, being a Bleſſing of that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can be got ſo eaſie as by believing only. Or if they grant it is to be had only by Believing, yet they do ſo much look upon perſonal Qualifications, by which to try their Faith, that unleſs it be to ſuch and ſuch a degree, they think they have not Faith. And when they have got the degree they deſire, they are as much to ſeek as before. And all is becauſe God has left no ſuch Qualifications as things that ſhall give reſt to the Soul, for they are but the Garments of Faith. That Soul that is willing Chriſt ſhould both ſave him and purge him, ſhall be ſaved and purged: and God cannot but account him clean from condemning Guilt. I hope you live in the Study and Conſolation of theſe glad Tidings of Goſpel-Peace. I truſt alſo that God has and doth ſanctifie
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:109216:141"/> all his Diſpenſations to your heart, that you may be chearful in believing, and fruitful in Holineſs, as one who is taught of the Lord: and thus commending you to the Lord, your Rock, I reſt yours in Truth and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>COuld I be more in the Spirit, I could then write with more freedom: but this I know, that if I and you have our faces towarn <hi>Sion,</hi> we ſhall be brought thither at length. Our great work is to ceaſe from our ſelves, that the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord might have liberty to work in us, and for us. I know no ſuch Door to the Mediator as to be reſigned over to him, and to be yielded up to the Salvation and Power of Free Grace: 'tis the only <hi>wholſome Food</hi> and <hi>Phyſick</hi> of a Sinner. When the Soul is widened by Reſignation to him, and Self-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency, then his naked Redemption is ſweet, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and a Soul-ſatisfying Remedy. I oft ſee a glimmering of this, but my eye is weak; yet ſuch glimmerings tell me, that there, and there only lies the Firſt-fruits, and hope of Glory. I had rather ſee God do a little in me, and for me, than do much my ſelf; for God's Little is infinite, and my Much is nothing in his ſight, for me to be accepted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Therefore is Faith the only Key of all ſpiritual Treaſure which is hid in Chriſt, and in him only. And by this going out of our ſelves to him, we are made his; and himſelf, and his Treaſures of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Righteouſneſs, Wiſdom, and Perfection is made ours. Venture your Prayers upon him, though they ſeem to be caſt away, after many days they will return. You can hardly find that ever Chriſt reproved his Diſciples for any thing but Unbelief, or little Faith; or for not ſuffering Infants or others to come to him. Let all theſe things teach you and I what is our chief Duty. I leave you to the Lord, remaining yours in truth and love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>YOur two laſt Letters have much refreſhed me, becauſe I perceive it is not the <hi>Complement of Invention,</hi> but the <hi>heart-raiſing Spirit of God</hi> has been favourable to you. Be craving ſtill, be thankful ſtill, believe through the Clouds. God has thus appeared, that he may teach you how to live on him when he appears leſs to Senſe: you are Heir always to the ſame Joy, and infinitely more when under the ſaddeſt hours. Expect Trials for every Grace, eſpecially for Faith; Winter follows Summer, but the end will be Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Peace; of which you have had, I perceive, a Taſte. Covet Chriſt's Image inſatiably, and to be at his diſpoſe univerſally; and let us bleſs his Name night and day. I want a heart to bleſs God enough for his goodneſs to us; the day haſtens in which it will be done perfectly. I am in health of Body labouring under the ſhameful load of an evil heart; yet in hope of Victory, through him <hi>who liveth for ever, to make Interceſſion for them who deſire to come to God through him only.</hi> Amongſt all buſineſs, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private, it is good for you and I to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to keep a conſtant motion upwards: conſtant Tenderneſs is a rich Treaſury. Grace is that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Endowment, enough to put a luſtre upon every other Requiſite. What Alliance is greater than to be allied in the Communion of the Spirit. I perceive God hath favoured you with an Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I hope you ſhall not go without the Bleſſing of it. Be more importunate for a Bleſſing, than anxious about the Loſs, or troubling your thoughts about Perſons or Inſtruments, or about future Events; but commit your ſelf and Eſtate, Body and Soul to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:109216:145"/> God, <hi>as unto a faithful Creator,</hi> and rejoyce in the hope of a <hi>better Reſurrection,</hi> and groan for nothing <hi>but the Body of Sin, till it is groaned out of doors.</hi>

               <p>I Am glad to ſee you ſtrive to get up the Hill, and do take the right way.

You can never lay too much burthen on Chriſt; he <hi>bears up the Pillars of the Earth,</hi> and has already born your burthen: the work is over with him, and ſhall be over with you too ſhortly. <hi>Yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry.</hi> You are not your own Workmanſhip, but his: he has lifted up his hand to Heaven, and ſworn, that <hi>Bleſſing, he will bleſs you,</hi> and ſhortly tread Satan and every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption under your feet. Cling about him, he will not ſhake you off; your Prayers are heard, your Perſon is accepted. Be not weary, <hi>everlaſting Arms</hi> are under you, the Battel you are in will proſper. The greatneſs of his Power is not to amaze you, but to ſupport you; his Righteouſneſs is to juſtifie you, that you may not fear your Judge, but reverence and love him who has waſhed you in his own blood: and the buſineſs is done already, and now there is no revoking of it. The more difficulties do appear, the more you are to triumph in him who overcame by the Blood of his Croſs, and will not leave you

               <p>I Thought good to ſend you a Line or two. I am my ſelf, through the goodneſs of God, in health, and in hope of greater things to the Inner Man than I can yet attain. My Life is a Warfare in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; O, bleſſed be the Lord that is never weary of ſuch a defiled Lump, but holds my Soul in ſome life to this day, with expectation that he will never leave, till the <hi>Wilderneſs be made a fruitful Field,</hi> and the Old Man be utterly deſtroyed; for ſtrong is he who hath promiſed, and there ſhall be a performance to the patient attending on his Word. God doth ſo order the bringing about of our eternal Reſt, that when he has lifted us over all the Mountains and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of this preſent Pilgrimage, he may at length be admired in them that believe; and give matter of eternal Praiſe, when we ſhall look back, and ſee
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:109216:146"/> how we have eſcaped the devouring Floods; and by his hand, behold all the preſent ſpiritual Enemies lie dead for ever. The Weary ſhall be refreſhed, the longing Soul ſatisfied, the Captive delivered, and the Scattered be yet gathered, and return to <hi>Zion.</hi> The Zeal of a faithful and gracious God, and our Redeemer will accompliſh this. Be things how they will, yet we are not allowed to ſay, Our Wound is incurable; but rather ſay, Salvation is of God, and he will be ſurpaſſingly wonderful to them that wait on him. What though the Fig-Tree do not bloſſom, yet God cannot alter the Word that is gone out of his Mouth; <hi>Fear not, for I have redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee,</hi> Iſa. 43. 1, &amp;c. <hi>Thou art mine, to revive the ſpirit of the humble,</hi> Iſa. 57. 15.

               <p>SUch is our bodily condition, that we cannot make up theſe diſtances, without the intervening of Letters or Friends; but that Communion which, I truſt, we have mutually (though under much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) with the Father and the Son, by the Spirit of Grace, needs no ſuch helps. I truſt, our Prayers meet at a ſhorter Cut, and that we ſtrive together in the ſame Faith of the Goſpel.

One Chriſtian ſeems
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:109216:147"/> to out-run another, till God reveal the miſchievous Hell that dwells in our Fleſh.

'Twas only the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Son of Man that made the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>Daniel,</hi> walk up and down in the Fire, and yet ſafe from burning. <hi>I will be with you,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>in the Fire and Water:</hi> his Name is <hi>Emanuel, God with us:</hi> His Covenant is free, the Purpoſe of Grace wonderful; his good Will ariſeth only from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and will not; cannot change; and therefore <hi>the Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi> We little think oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (in our fear and diſcouragement) how far our weak Prayers reach; they are like an Arrow gone out of our ſight, and we (many times) think them loſt and forgot; and conſider not that every dry Groan and watery Tear is put into the Bottle, and winds up through the aſcending vertue of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of him who is one with the Father, to the Throne of Acceptation.

               <p>THe Lord teach us his mind, and looſen us from a preſent World, and gather our hearts and hopes near to himſelf. 'Tis one of our invaluable Privileges, that this is not our Reſt: God calls aloud, <hi>Come up hither:</hi> Chriſt is above, holding the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace in his Right Hand, and all his broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Mourners, and Priſoners of Hope wrapped up in it, as in a Mantle. Dear Siſter, all things are ſafe, becauſe they are in the heart of Chriſt; and I doubt not but Chriſt is yours. Spare not to pray, ſpare not to repent with grief and joy, ſpare not to relie on the Rock of Ages: 'tis all but the work of a beloved Spouſe towards a matchleſs Husband. Your Work and Labour in the Lord cannot but be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: Set your eyes towards the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; your Beloved haſtens like a young Roe, and will not be at reſt till he has reſcued home all his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the dearly beloved of his Soul amongſt which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I am much aſſured your Name is entred; ſuch are the Riches of his Grace to ſuch a wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

               <p>AS for your own fears under which you wreſtle, it is not the having or wanting earthly Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility that is any proper Character of God's Love or Anger; but the diſcovering mark of that lies chiefly in the way of our deportment under ſuch Trials, agreeable to the practice of the Saints, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:109216:151"/> to us in the Scriptures by the Spirit of God. For there is no Temptation can befall us, which has not been (for ſubſtance) the Trial of them who have endured and overcome before us: And you are required to remember their faith and patience, and the iſſue God gave, that you do not ſuccumb or faint; as if God had forſaken the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, or changed the nature of the <hi>everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure.</hi> I have been labouring to live upon the naked Promiſes of God, in reference to my outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, as if I were in the want of all things; and do think if I could come at it, it were a glorious Portion. None but exerciſed Believers can tell tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly why the Promiſes are called <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>precious,</hi> and how much lies in that word (RICH IN FAITH) <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. and what extenſive Satisfaction and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lies in that word (GOOD) <hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi> You know theſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As fears or outward diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments abound, fly ſtill a higher pitch; till you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in manifold Trials, that God counts you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be liſted among them, who could not be made happy by earthly things, nor miſerable in the want of all things; whether Eſtate, Friends, Health, Credit, or any thing elſe, whilſt they could fly to a higher Rock. The Lord direct you, and make you lanch forth upon the Power, and in the Wiſdom, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shelter of the Lord: Infinite and abundant is that Shelter.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:109216:152"/> open ſuch a Window from Heaven, that both you and I, and all that ſeek the Lord may be throughly transformed to a hearty joy, even in <hi>divers Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and know the reaſon, through his Grace, why the bleſſed Spirit did put that Clauſe into the holy Scriptures, for our patience and ſolid Comfort, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2.

               <p>GOd is a ſtrong Refuge; and as you have found it, you will yet find it the more you roll your ſelf, Family, and Eſtate upon him. He is one that can forgive Sin, and give Chriſt; and can he not then give all things with him? He can take away a treacherous heart, and make it new. Acceſs for your Prayer is always open; and will not he take away an evil heart of Unbelief, that the Soul and he may meet together. Let us fear and hope, reach forth, and touch the Golden Scepter, and live in his ſight. The Viſion is true, which Faith in the Word diſcovers. Oh, happy is the humble Believer; for there ſhall be a performance of all things promiſed. Though the Mountains be caſt into the midſt of the Seas, <hi>God is a refuge for us, Selah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>WHatever hazards or difficulties you may fear, they are all under the compaſs of God's abſolute diſpoſe; and the ſame Faith that carries us to reſt on him for one thing, in ſelf-denying depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance (which at this time God calls upon us, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and graciouſly to exerciſe) the ſame Faith (having ſuch a God and Chriſt in its eye) is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and under promiſe of Succeſs to all things. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth, Mar.</hi> 9. 23. As once Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Remember</hi> Lot's <hi>Wife;</hi> ſo I would ſay to you, Remember <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how infirmly he carried the matter, although his Faith and Obedience was ſtronger than his Wives in the general; and being ſincere, was accepted: yet, although he ſaw the Wonders of God before his face, and his irreſiſtable Power, in deſtroying thoſe Cities in that manner, and preſerving him, as a Father would preſerve a Child; yet he feared to go to the Mountain where God appointed him, leſt he periſhed. And when he was in <hi>Zoar,</hi> a Town which God told him, he would ſave for his ſake; yet there alſo he was afraid, and departed thence; as if he had no longer an Intereſt in the Power of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:109216:153"/> God to ſave him. And how ſadly he fell when he thought he had ſecured himſelf in a Cave, the ſtory doth relate. And ſuch like Inſtances doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture yield in the Hiſtory of <hi>Jacob, David,</hi> and others. And becauſe, after every Exerciſe of Faith, we are apt to enter into a Cave, God doth hold out new Matter for our Exerciſe; as it were, to keep us in the open Air, to make our Faith hardy and Warlike. God loves not to have his Children crule about the Fire-ſide, the refuge and ſparks of their own kindling; but for their healths ſake, enures them to the Weather, that they may be hardy in believing; according as the variety, and difficulty, and hazards do appear, and the imagination of ſuch things ſtart into the Mind. Let us beg of God the practice of our own Letters one to another, and we ſhall yet ſee the Salvation of God in that kind as ſhall be beſt; even it may be to the outward Man. He that can be contented to venture his Eſtate, his Safety, his Credit, his Soul, his Body, his Labours, and the Succeſs of them barely upon God; and ſit down, and ſing a Pſalm to his Almighty Mercy, Goodneſs and Truth: that Man has got a Caſtle over his head, let the Wind blow which way it will. And herein the bleſſed God and Giver of Faith will not fail, no more than the Truth of his Nature, and Truth of his Word can change. I would fain be at this practice. However, I muſt ſo far commend the way of my God, and juſtifie the method of his Diſcipline, both to me and to you; that the Crown of our Profeſſion, and the Glory of a Chriſtian Life, lies in this Life, in this kind of Life of Believing. I do experience ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obſtructions againſt clear Dependance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the ſafe hand of God's Power and Love,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:109216:154"/> and ſo many aching, contradicting fits of Fleſh and Blood, that it would in ſome ſenſe, grieve me to put any friend that acts only in a carnal Mind, upon ſuch uncouth work as this is. But knowing that you have already ſtarted the Game, I would have you purſue merrily to perfect Surrender, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in God. Believe it as bad a place as you are in; God has made it for a ſeaſon, his School to you; and till God doth ſome way clear things by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for your Remove, expect more practical Teaching, and more Shelter under his Wing where you are, than elſewhere; although your company would be to me exceeding deſirable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Having had ſome opportunity to diſcern the frame of your heart, and the truth of your Thirſt after Jeſus Chriſt, and Reſignation up to him, I thought fit, while I was writing to other Friends at <hi>N. C.</hi> to preſent you alſo a Line or two. 'Tis but a little that one Friend can write to another: but where there is a mutual Intereſt in the ſame Spirit, there is a Freedom through that Communion, to expatiate large and wide in one anothers joynt Concernments; and to bear a ſence of the various Travels of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, and how it is exerciſed in you who are begotten of the ſame God and Father, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame Spirit in Jeſus Chriſt. And in this reſpect, one Chriſtian may in ſome meaſure read the Condition and Affairs of another in his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, though the manner of Trials may be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. The moſt that I would ſay to you is this; Labour to ſatisfie your heart againſt Guilt, by the perſonal Righteouſneſs and Worth of Chriſt, which you are commanded to own, and put on by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a Garment made and appointed of God for your wearing; fixing your eye on his Appointment, and not upon your Unſuitableneſs; on his Grace, and not at all on your own Worthineſs; unleſs it be to urge you towards him with the more ſpeed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. This is a Leſſon I am every day learning, and I know no ſhelter like it. The Improvement of the Covenant of Grace in this manner, was to the Prophet <hi>David, all his Salvation, and all his deſire.</hi> This is the Shelter that will keep dry when the Floods come.

He takes Sinners to himſelf, that he may ſpend Intimacy of Good Will upon them; and never lets them go quite out of his hands any more. Oh, how little do we know him! How little do we remember that every Conviction we have had, every Groan, every deſire of Soul after him, was born firſt in his heart, and given to us as
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:109216:156"/> the <hi>new Creatures Food, to ripen it for Glory.</hi> We breath towards him in the ſtrength of his own Breath. We may be yet much more winnowed, but cannot be loſt, nor our Faith quite fail; becauſe he prays for us as never meer Man did. His Prayers cannot but ſpeed; for the Will of the Father, Son, and Spirit is one Will, for they are one God; and that Will is nothing but good Will to us, who hope in him, and catch hold of his free Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good-Will to Men.

Ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular thereof.</hi> And what a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intereſt is that? Firſt Chriſt's, and then one
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:109216:157"/> anothers in him. Something of this Affinity appears in the Contentment of that mutual Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but more in the mutual Faith in which they communicate with one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 12. The Streams are obvious to our ſence; but the Streams would dry up, if the Fountain did not feed them. The more we put on Jeſus Chriſt, the more doth the <hi>Morning-Star of Perfection,</hi> in that and all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, <hi>twinkle upon us.</hi> Still honor God ſo as to lean upon him, and love him, and all the method he takes. Nothing doth ſo much bring diſquiet, as diſappointment; and nothing doth ſo much bring diſappointment, as the fixing ones expectation upon Uncertainties. Be ever therefore trimming up your Expectations on things above, where Chriſt is, and abides for ever. <hi>Diſſolve into his good Will,</hi> and he will never diſappoint your Hope, nor ſuffer you to be at an utter loſs. What think you is the very meaning of that place, <hi>Hab. 3. 17, 18. Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bleſſom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet will I rejoyce in the Lord?</hi> &amp;c. Doth it not ſpeak out this? <hi>viz.</hi> That God is the ſame, his Word the ſame, when all things fail beſides. If I have diſquiet or fears, let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what it is that I fear, and on what Ground; whether about my preſent, or future State of Body or Soul? And let me not make Queſtions nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, but what Scripture doth countenance. I may make uſe of former Experiences of my own or others, as they bear witneſs to Divine Writ, in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and ſo be thankful: but I may not make the Experiences of any ſort my Rule, nor Guide of my Faith. My meaning is; We are apt to oppoſe ſomething or other that we find by Obſervation or Experience, againſt the Word of the living God; or expound the great and faithful Promiſes by thoſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:109216:158"/> Experiences or Obſervations. As where it is ſaid, <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you. I will ſend you the Comforter, and he ſhall teach you all things. I will ſatisfie the longing Soul. I will give a new heart. I will circumciſe your hearts to love me. The Righteous ſhall not want any good thing. Their Soul ſhall not be deſolate. No Evil ſhall come near them. Your Sins, and your Iniquities I will remember no more,</hi> and ſuch like; which abounds throughout the Scriptures. We are apt to caſt cold Water out of our Experiences and Obſervations upon thoſe Promiſes, rather than kindle our Faith at them; and ſo live by Faith on them. We are apt to ſay, yea; but I do not find it ſo: I find Sin prevails againſt me, my Graces wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my Conſcience clamours, my heart is hard; I pray, and have no Anſwer; my Condition is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and I fear it will be worſe. He that ſaid, <hi>No Evil ſhall come near,</hi> doth yet ſuffer his people to be greatly diſtreſſed; even ſo far ſometimes as to die under it, and therefore it is not directed to me; or there is not that ſoveraign Good in it, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſeems to proclaim. But I would ſay as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Conſider wiſely concerning this.</hi> 'Tis impoſſible the Oath and Promiſe of God ſhould fail; the miſtake is on our part, conſidering not the Work of the Lord, and the Operation of his hands. He trieth, rooteth, and teacheth Faith by ways of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for Chriſt is always labouring in this Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. <hi>The Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> ſaith he. His great deſign is to reveal himſelf, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize his People into the Spirit of his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. He ſlays Sin by ſuffering his People ſometimes to be, in a ſence, ſlain by it; that they more fully die from their own Power, into his Life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 19. He brings the Soul to an utter ſtreſs,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:109216:158"/> to make it look out, and venture upon him; as the three Leppers, who to flee from Famine, ventured to flee to an Enemies Army. When he would bring his People from ſenſible Refuges, and from a Man's perſonal Worth, and inherent Strength, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gets in like Ruſt upon the Soul; he daſheth all that, to teach us, that our Life and every Act of it is the meer Operation of his Grace, who lives, moves, and breaths in his People. How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible we ſhould know Patience, but by Sufferings; and the infinite Power and Truth of God in great Deliverances, if the Sun did always ſhine upon us? This made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>In very faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted me:</hi> and <hi>Paul; I will rejoyce in mine infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or weakneſſes, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi> Growth of Grace lies chiefly in more and more expertneſs in owning of, and living nakedly on the Good that is in Chriſt, as being really mine own; and deriving Good from him by perpetual Motion. Man's Life lies not ſo much in his Breath, as in his Breathing; ſo it is with ſpiritual Life, exerciſing freſh and freſh Acts of Recourſe to Jeſus Chriſt: And by this means the Soul comes at length to be bathed in the Comfort of his Truth and Love by an operating Faith. Let my Condition be what it will, inwardly or outwardly, I am not to be diſmayed from running to God, and encouraging my ſelf in him. But my work is to liſten out what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves or teacheth thereby; holding this as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable Truth, <hi>That his love never fails from his People one moment; and his People are they who in good earneſt chuſe him for their God;</hi> whoſe very hearts fly and hanker after him; ſuch who come to God by Chriſt, who deſign that as their Aim. The whole Scripture doth juſtifie this plain difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:109216:159"/> perſons and perſons; <hi>viz.</hi> they who come to the light, and they who hate it, <hi>Joh</hi> 3. 20, 21. Now I ſay, <hi>My work is never to let my heart queſtion his love to me: If he has made me to hanker after him, and if he loves continually, then there is continually room for Acceſs to him.</hi> 'Tis true that he hath ſuffered his People ſometimes to fall grievouſly; as <hi>David</hi> and others; and he hid his face upon it: But did we ever read, that he did turn away from the Prayer of the Poor; and while it is nothing elſe but his own Spirit interceding in them, and Chriſt for them? 'Tis not imaginable, though he ſeems not to anſwer ſometimes, yet he loves their voice continually. Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> an acting out of our own Life, in the Life and ſpirit of Chriſt, for all manner of good from God by him, is and was always a conquering ſucceſsful Grace: In the greateſt Surge it gives ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Contentation, or it haſtens the opening of the Door for Deliverance; and uſually both together, one way or other. 'Tis a ſad thing, that when we ſhould be exerciſing Faith for getting the good of an Affliction, and prying after further Diſcoveries of God's Truth, Love and Wiſdom; and enquiring what the voice of our Father is, and what it means. I ſay, it is a ſad thing that at that time we ſhould ſpend our thoughts in an unſeaſonable diſtruſt of an Intereſt in him. His Rod, his Trials walk up and down among his People, to ſhew he is their Father, and his Diſcipline is amongſt his Children; and yet we are apt to take the very ſign of our Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make it an occaſion of our diſtruſt that we are not related to him. This Wiſdom comes not from above, but is carnal, ſenſual, and unworthy of them who have heard the Word of Faith; yea, and accepted it alſo for many years. 'Tis bad tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:109216:159"/> God, and vexing his Spirit in that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh him moſt. But if I think I was not related to him before, let me fly to him in Chriſt now, and I ſhall be his, though I was not actually ſo before; for he caſts away no ſincere Comer. But I do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you armed by the Lord to encounter theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and am perſuaded your Faith will grow by every Trial; yea, when 'tis moſt aſſaulted, you will be made to expect ſome good in the Rear; which will make you glorifie God, even in the Fires. Dear Siſter, I commend you to the Lord: Chriſt prays for you, and therefore your faith cannot fail. He will be Eyes to the Blind, Feet to the Lame: He will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he with-hold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IN purſuance of my Promiſe, and alſo that the mutual Remembrance of each other may be kept alive, I account my ſelf engaged to preſent you theſe Lines. 'Tis one comfort that the Lord rules the World; yea, no other but that God to whom the Supplications of his People are always acceptable in Jeſus Chriſt, and that nothing can be perfectly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable to them who are conſtituted Heirs of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and paſt away from the Curſe through the Curſe of Chriſt. And though the glorious Arm and Truths of God ſeem to be overwhelmed in the World, yet when God ſhall appear to vindicate his Name, and cloath himſelf with Jealouſie, what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhall hinder his Courſe, or ſtop his hand? I know you are not only ſtrugling with difficulties without, as well as I am, but with Enemies within;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:109216:160"/> and truly that is my caſe alſo. And I know nothing that keeps me from being overwhelmed but only this, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome blinks of the free and eternal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Bounty of God, who has for his own ſake only, pitch'd upon ſuch an unworthy Creature, and cauſed my Soul to hanker after him. When I am tired out with my own Darkneſs, Infirmity, Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Unbelief, his good Spirit is pleaſed ſometimes to ſway my heart to throw my ſelf, Body and Soul, and all my Sins and Cares upon him through Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo out of my own Shame and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of face, there darts in ſometimes a Beam of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from him, who <hi>quickeneth the Dead, and calleth the things that are not as if they were.</hi> Could we come off more ſmoothly to own and catch that Hold upon Jeſus Chriſt which the Word of God's Grace doth invite us to, we might lanch forth, and venture ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in the Ark Jeſus Chriſt, when there is not a Foot of dry Ground here below to ſtand upon. When we cannot pray, then to remember Chriſt intercedes. When we are all over defiled and confuſed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Mediator is cloathed with our Nature, and that on our behalf, in perfect Purity, and in the ſame Nature which each of us doth bear. He did conquer over all that which we are as yet conflicting with (in his Name.) That we are eſteemed not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our preſent Infirmity, but according to that Perfection to which we are entitled in him who is at God's Right Hand. Could we be more exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in this view and bleſſed proſpect; it would make our dry and dead Limbs recover heat and life; as it was with <hi>Jacob</hi> when he heard that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was yet alive; Joſeph <hi>our Brother is yet alive: And all Power is committed into his hands; he has the Keys of Hell and Death, and is himſelf the Door of Life alſo.</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:109216:160"/> Oh, how unperſuadable are our hearts for the moſt part, and loath to credit the Word of his Grace and Truth, ſo far as to reſign up our ſelves, our ſins, our burthens of all ſorts to the vertue and power of his Atonement and Soveraignty, who has ended all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and brought in an everlaſting Righteouſneſs and Good Will, that a righteous God and ſinful Man might be reconciled together in him who has ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Account exactly; and being gone, has left a Legacy of Bleſſing and Peace to every Soul that flees to him to feed upon, till the days of full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing appears, and we ſee him as he is. When I only muſe my own weakneſs, it makes me more weak; while I converſe with anxious thoughts, it makes my heart dark, ſower and feeble; but <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Sins, Cares, Fears, and Diſquiets fly before one hearty Cloſure with Chriſt, his Power and Grace by Faith.</hi> If Chriſt in the Soul ſaith I AM HE, whole Troops of Adverſaries fall backwards, Difficulties vaniſh, and deſponding Conſultations of Unbelief in our Fleſh fly as Duſt before the Wind; and that becauſe our Redeemer is ſtrong, though we are weak. Methinks ſometimes 'tis pity that we ſhould hear ſo much, read ſo much ſpoke or writ, to each other ſo ordinarily of this certain real Refuge, and yet account it not more real. What a thing is this that Chriſt hath engaged, that not one of his ſhall be able to loſe what he purchaſed and bequeathed for them! Such a good Will, and free Grace, that our Sins ſhall never be able to ſin away, no more than they can be able to ſin away Chriſt from the Right Hand of his Father; for were it otherwiſe, we were undone every moment. Who is it that maintains any Thirſt after him that enables poor Duſt and Aſhes to conflict againſt all the powers of Darkneſs;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:109216:161"/> and of weak, ſometimes becomes ſtrong? Who is it that maintains any indignation againſt the Law of our Fleſh that is in our Members, but he who hath overcome in his own Perſon, and will ſhortly tread down Satan under our feet alſo, and is haſtning the day when the laſt Enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, and every Sigh and Tear removed. Let us comfort our hearts in this, and pray for each other, that we may, as good Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>fight this good Fight of Faith, laying hold on Eternal Life;</hi> and ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the Miſeries of a preſent evil World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pray preſent my hearty Reſpects to your Daughter, whoſe Soul I know is labouring in this Work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

It may be you may little think how it chears the heart of Chriſt to ſee you ſit down and ſing a Pſalm of Praiſe for all his Loving-kindneſſes in the midſt of Worldly Darkneſs.

               <p>I Perceive your Family is ſtill viſited. The God of the Spirits of all Fleſh knows what Scourges are moſt ſuitable for them whom he deſigns for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Honour, and Eternal Life; among whom I truſt, you and your Yoak-fellow are enrolled. There is hope that good lies in the bottom, when the heart is drawn the more to ſeek, reſign up to, and wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the Salvation of God, to a delightful thought of the Appearance of Chriſt, and your ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering to him; the whole World cannot purchaſe one quarter of an hours free Acceſs to God. If he draws and drives the heart to himſelf, let us bleſs and love him, whatever means he uſeth to bring it about. I deſire to bleſs the Lord that you are ſtriving to trace the ſteps of that Faith that believed under hope, above hope: ſuch Faith, ſuch Hope will never return aſhamed. I am ſtrugling with the ſame difficulties, and none can help me but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Promiſer; who is able to quicken his Word to me, and ſoaken my heart to mix it with Faith. As you write he has not been a barren Wilderneſs to you (which is unſpeakable Grace) ſo I have often found; and therefore I have hope, that at length he will perfect the deſign of favour and pity upon ſuch a poor Worm. Lord help you and me to find Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the Valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> till the laſt Sourge be over, and every Tear removed. We have no other way now to communicate with each other, but <hi>in Prayers and Faith, Affections and Letters.</hi> Letters indeed may miſcarry, but no earthly Obſtruction can hinder the three former: Faith and Prayer flies inviſibly, and Chriſtian Affections alſo. As for my
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:109216:162"/> ſelf, the Lord is every day forcing my Soul to look out more after the myſterious privilege of his moſt abſolute free Grace in Chriſt. There the wearied find Reſt, the polluted finds purity, and the dejected find there an Anchor of Hope. Sometimes I am confounded in mine own thoughts, and my Prayers rather ſhame me than comfort me; then I ſtand ſtill, and look for the Salvation of God only: He ſends his naked Arm out of the thick Cloud, and creates ſome Beam of Light and Refuge, which makes a Pilgrim ſing in a Land of darkneſs. He ſeems to be gone ſometimes, but returns again. He withdraws, but never bids farewell utterly. He ſuffers me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to tumble in mine own filth, but brings me to the Laver again; to the <hi>Fountain opened to the Houſe of</hi> David, &amp;c. <hi>for Sin and Uncleanneſs.</hi> His unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Purpoſe and Grace holds its Courſe as the Sun; and therefore poor Worms are never undone, though never ſo low. Could I more actually reſign up to his Will, and read that Golden Line of his Love that runs within every Providence of his, and in every part of his Diſcipline, and put my Seal to it, how might I triumph; and ſay, <hi>O Sin, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Death?</hi> He daſheth earthly Comforts, that himſelf might comfort alone: he ſuffers Corruption to ſwell and rage, that he may appear to be the only mighty Redeemer: he glorifies the Excellency of his Word, by forcing the Soul thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Refuge. Brother, let us be flying into this Ark, his Word endures to a thouſand Generations: we have the ſame God, and no other than what <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob; Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had. He never left a poor Supplicant, nor will do it; for the Spirit of Supplication is his own Breath; and himſelf deeply concerned in all the Concernments
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:109216:163"/> of his People: they are his, and their Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his alſo. Let us muſe this Privilege ſeriouſly, and glorifie his good Will by Faith and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſo rejoyce in believing above hope. The Lord be a hiding place to you and me; never yield to let him go: but let us cling faſt by Faith and Hope, till he cauſe Salvation and Light to ſhine forth out of Obſcurity, and Comfort all that mourn. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God by Faith, Patience and Thankfulneſs; loſe not that, and you will be no loſer; though the day be dark, the Sun is not down. The times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing will come to us, and we to them; for our Redeemer lives for ever. I leave you to that God, and remain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THat's the happieſt Man or Woman in the World that can truly hear the voice of God in his Rod. That happy profit I preſs and long for; and that happineſs I heartily wiſh to your ſelf and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that as God hath made you Partners in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you would endeavour to the utmoſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each others Faith and holy Patience in a ſtormy day. Afflictions, be they what they will, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make you miſerable. Nothing makes the Rod tedious, but unwarrantable vexations of Spirit; and in days of trouble, that is the uſual Temptation; and there is no ſuch Cure as the naked ſight of God's wiſe diſpoſing hand. If there have been any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving thoughts between you, about future Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments relating to your ſelves and your Children, as under ſuch Surges you have met withal, our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is very apt unto; ſpread that infirmity before the

All the Scriptures be full of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and infallible grounds of Conſolation; yet ſuch is our Carnality, Darkneſs, and Unbelief many times, that we think the Rock cannot yield Honey: and ſo we gage things by fleſhly and worldly Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and are apt ſecretly to condemn the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs, and Faithfulneſs of God before we are aware; whereas the only way to find the Pearl of real advantage in the bleſſed Word, is to lay the heart to the Word by an exerciſe of Faith; and then roll the Soul upon the Lord, though it ſeems to be never ſo much againſt that Senſe and Reaſon which Fleſh and Blood is always dictating to us. Dear Siſter, I muſt confeſs I travel under a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heart of mine own, which is ever betraying away my Peace, my Strength, my Faith, and Hope; and that is my daily burthen: but I never come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord with any openneſs, and unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to him for Pardon and Succour in vain. I am ſomewhat a Partner with you in the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Waves of a preſent World, but cannot call it diſmal ſo long as God doth in ſome meaſure ſteer my Courſe in any ſincerity after him. Let us provoke one another to this, and the Storm will be over; the day will break, and the darkſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows will flee away; or we ſhall flee through, or flee beyond them; for faithful is he that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>

               <p>LEt it be your and my ſtudy ſtill to derive mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Power from the Grace and Croſs of him who was dead, and is alive: I mean the Lamb who ſtands before the Throne in the vertue of his own Sacrifice, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 6. perpetually to intercede for effectuating all the ends of his Mediation to them who come to God through him. Our Prayers wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with faith in Chriſt, and fellow-feeling one of another's troubles, may fly faſter than Letters can; and there is no fear of their miſcarriage, if once
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:109216:164"/> placed by faith in the Mediator's hand. The Lord who dwells in Houſes not made with hands, is the Habitation of his People. Let the fulneſs of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Contentment that is on the other ſide <hi>Jordan</hi> ſo warm our hope and faith, that nothing on this ſide may diſcompoſe. And Oh that I could dwell more in the view of him who is lifted up to draw all Men to him; that ſo theſe earthly Affections might be transformed, and fetch ſatiating delight from the place where Chriſt ſits, who is even now our life. I commend you to him; at his Throne let us meet, and make merry in the Author of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and our bleſſed Hope.</p>

               <p>TRuly Siſter, I do ſometimes wonder at the ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs of my heart, that can be ſo affected with the Chriſtian tender Reſpects of a dear Friend, and yet have no more flames of Affection to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Love and Lovelineſs. Methinks nothing makes any Friend truly excellent in my thoughts but Grace, and the Inhabitation of Chriſt there. And if a Beam of his Grace creates a delightful Aſpect where-ever it pitches, how excellent for Perfection is Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? Sometimes our hearts are apt to fancy Chriſt as if he were humourſome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, as if he would make the worſt of things, and not the better; ſometimes as if he had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, were far off, did not hear, were reſerved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ready to take exceptions, and ſuch like: whereas we may go to a poor lump of Clay; where a ſpark of his Nature dwells, and have ſometimes a taſte of that Affection that is ſcarce capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:109216:165"/> back any ſuch prejudices, or the leaſt ſhadow of them. And the reaſon is, becauſe there is a root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſuaſion of ſome predominant Principle of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſpiritual, and reciprocal Love. O then how ſeriouſly ſhould we pray that our hearts might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected into the Love of Chriſt, and that it may be ſhed abroad in our hearts. A Chriſt who loves once, ever, always, and to the full, he loveth: he loved and came; he loved, and died; he loved, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the everlaſting Goſpel; he loves, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; he loves, and teaches; he loves, and reproves; he loves, and holds faſt for ever; he loves, and ſaves. When a Soul is ſunk as deep as Hell in ſin and filth; in love he redeems that Soul, as out of a Jaques; and is not aſhamed, nor thinks it much to cleanſe it again, becauſe Love conſtrains him. All his ways (not one excepted) are Mercy and Truth to them that fear him. He has a noble and ſurmounting Love, not capable of Melancholy, Miſpriſion, or Miſtake. He knew all the defects of his Spouſe before <hi>he betrothed himſelf to her in loving Kindneſs, and tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And he ſo far abhors the declining of his Love, that the very beholding of any defect there inflames his heart to remove it, that he may preſent her to himſelf without ſpot.</hi> When we have any Agony againſt our ſins, doth this come from the Fleſh? Is it not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord's Arm? What ſhall I ſay? The Lord reveal himſelf, that we may purely rejoyce in God our Maker; and cling upon him in the vertue and power of his own unſearchable and endleſs Grace and Love. I long for other Society than I can have here: few Friends here, and little help; eſpecially as to that Intereſt in which you and I are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: but there is a River that never dries up, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:109216:165"/> a Counſellor that never fails. I am yet in health; and as to outward freedom, as it was when I came hither firſt; but not without ſome daily Exerciſes: but my chief Adverſary lurks within, which God will one day deſtroy, and all Warfare will be over. Let us pray to him for each other, for it is not in vain.</p>

               <p>DEar Sir, However it goes with you, I truſt, you have no reaſon to count your ſelf alone, whilſt ſo good a Friend hath ſaid, <hi>I will be with you in the fire, and water.</hi> When we are at any plunge, then is a time to act Scripture-Reaſon, and not worldly Reaſon; and draw ſuch Concluſions in reference to Soul and Body, as the Wiſdom and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:109216:166"/> Truth of God doth teach. The Lord make his Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to be purifying at this day. Some in one kind, ſome in another have their various Trials, but the <hi>Father of Mercies</hi> doth govern the matter; ſo that at the Cloſe, <hi>it ſhall be well with the Righteous.</hi> Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with might and main to keep up good thoughts of God, and the glory of our Intereſt in him. Though the Heaven and Earth do ſhake, the ſenſe of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant cannot change; his Son cannot be dethroned, nor the Promiſes of his Grace and Preſence turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Blood of a dead Man. Clouds may darken the Sun as to us, but they can never diminiſh the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light of the Sun, nor ſtop its Courſe. The Sun is as nigh the Earth when Clouds do interpoſe, as it was before; and our dear Lord is now as near his afflicted ones, as when the Branch of earthly things was never ſo green in their hands. Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Love to the Lord Jeſus are glorious Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a Pilgrim, travelling towards that City that hath Foundations. Sir, I know not how it fares with you, but I doubt not but it goes well: For can any dealings of an infinite wiſe God, a faithful and gracious Father be amiſs; ſeeing he has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and will not fail to give <hi>Grace and Glory, and will with-hold no good thing from them that fear him.</hi> Let us not deny his Truth by Unbelief, nor his Love by a lowring Diſpondency of heart; however the Waves riſe and ſwell, he is above them; and the great Redemption is near.</p>

Had we more dexterity in believing, we might ſteer a comfortable Courſe, when all ſight of dry Land is out of ſight. And ſuch a Faith is God's Gift, who has promiſed us every good thing. Let us both go <hi>to the Creator of the ends of the Earth</hi> for Faith, and by Faith wait for more Faith; that we may ride out the Storm, and not be aſhamed or wearied out under the Croſs. How 'tis with you I know not; but I have much confidence you are in as ſafe hands, and in the boſom of as tender love as ever did ſhine upon you in the days of more earthly fulneſs: and that the gracious Goodneſs of God, and his unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Wiſdom has ordered this preſent ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to exerciſe you withal. One half hours time beyond Mortality will make amends for all; and we are haſtening to it; and I truſt, at preſent freely entitled to the unalterable love of God, who will never leave nor forſake to pity and ſuccour the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of his own Grace. If the Lord favour me with his Counſel, and give me the Shield of his Preſence, I ſhall not be at a loſs.

               <p>I Am affected with your trouble, and yet comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in your faith and comfort. But who makes
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:109216:167"/> Rivers run in the Deſart, knows how to refreſh the dry Ground. When we hear News that our Troubles will one day expire, there is ſome refreſhment with it, and not a little ſupport the while. But Oh, for ever bleſſed be that glorious Hope, that not only outward Troubles, but Sin alſo ſhall be no more; yea, and that while we are ſtriving and toiling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Body of Sin; we are yet ſtated in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> brought over from a ſtate of Sin, to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Righteouſneſs, Acceptation, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. This is the Crown and Conqueſt of Faith, Hope, and Conſolation. <hi>All theſe things will I give;</hi> yea, ſaid the Tempter, <hi>if thou wilt fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me.</hi> Ah curſed and deceitful Proffer. Let my Portion and yours be found ſtill, and for ever in a crucified riſen Chriſt. If he loved us when he waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in his own Blood, then no ſlaying Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can ſeparate from the ſame Love: ſo that we may, muſing the matter aright, ſay, he loved me when he hurried me hither and thither, when he brake my Bones, emptied me from Veſſel to Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, made me as the Mire of the Street. Yet his Bleſſing once bequeathed, can never be revoked, nor his eternal Love change. Though his Paths are in the Deep, and his Ways and Judgments paſt finding out, while he maintains in our Souls a Cry after him (which is the voice of his own Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding in us) he hath not forgotten to be gracious, nor cauſed his Bowels to ceaſe from yearning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us. <hi>Sin only makes outward Burthens intollerable. Outward Troubles declare the venom of Sin, and tends to open the ear to inſtruct us: and ſo both of them ſends the Souls of the Redeemed to the Atonement of Chriſt's Blood for Healing, and into his Boſom for Refuge.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Brother, his Promiſes are as good now as they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:109216:167"/> were before the Storm roſe upon us; and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and Love, and Good Will ſmiles as much as ever, and when the Cloud is blown over and gone, we ſhall ſee it. Now to juſtifie God's truth, and ſubmit to his wiſe hand; to maintain good and honourable thoughts of him, and all his dealings, when ſo many things from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and alſo from within do war againſt it; this is like the faith of God's Elect, and doth in ſome bleſſed meaſure betoken the knowledge of what God is in himſelf, and what he is eternally to us, and that the Seed of God remaineth in us. I leave you in his hand, and to ſtrive under your Affairs, as he ſhall give you Wiſdom and Strength. Lord, purge and heal us; he will do it, and all will be well. Let us hold on to pray for each other, for the Viſion will ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yours to love and live with you in the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Have no other thing to recommend to you but this; that as you have already found this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World to be a ſlippery Foundation, ſo beware how you lay the whole ſtreſs of your Expectation upon it, or the perſons in it. A thirſty Man may dream that he drinketh; yet when he awakes he may faint. The drink of a Dream gives not nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'tis only the Water of Life, iſſuing from the Rock Chriſt, that is ſatisfying and healing; <hi>He that drinks thereof ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Frowns and favours of Men are ſome of the ſtrongeſt Engines the Devil has, to ſhake a Soul from ſimple and ſingle hearted following of the Lamb: and beſides them, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:109216:168"/> of our carnal and unbelieving hearts is ever watching to betray our poor Souls into a diſ-reliſh of the pure paths of Life; dulling the edge of Zeal, and blinding the eye from beholding the Excellency that lies in the Perſon of Chriſt crucified and riſen, and the excellent Grace that has ſhone from Heaven for recovering poor Sinners out of the Snare of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. So that <hi>you and I have need to be much attending at the Foot-ſtool of that Throne where the Lord of Life ſways the Scepter of Relief, Mercy, and ſaving Health for all Comers.</hi> Let my Portion be in the Fountain of Life, and not in the broken Ciſterns of earthly deceitful Contents. If you would ſave your ſelf from grieving the good Spirit of God (which I truſt, dwells in you) retire your ſelf as much as you can into the Contemplation of ſuch things as may cauſe the fear and love of God to be and remain with ſome odoriferous Verdure, and kindly grow in your Soul. And take an ingenious and ſerious view, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Plants of the Lord do flouriſh, or elſe are blighted: No leſs than an infiniteneſs of Power is requiſite to ſuch work; and he only who engageth his heart to it, lieth under the Promiſe of the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Heaven, to quicken and ſatisfie him with good things full of Marrow. I have no more, but recommending you to the Lord, to keep you from declining in a declining time; and that you may be preſerved from evil, and your Affections be where Chriſt is.

               <p>I Know you yearn after the ſame Country which I have ſome hope (through the Riches of that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:109216:168"/> Bounty that has appeared from Heaven to Men) to ſee; and when the Groans here below are over, to breath forth Bleſſing, Honour, and Praiſe to him who, I truſt, has loved us both, and waſhed us in his own Blood; and I have ſome ground to hope the number there will be one the more for your company. Only ſpend your love upon him, your delight in him, your deſires after him and every part of his Will; as well to carry the Croſs as wear the Crown, for both are privileges. When your heart is oppreſt with ſin or trouble, then think, Oh how free is he from ſin, who ſits Conqueror at the Right Hand of God, as my Advocate, Surety, Redeemer; yea, my principal ſelf; whoſe I am by his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, more than I am mine own. Sins, evil thoughts, Heart-luſts, diſpondency of Spirit ſhall not always teare and torment; for he has judged them in his Fleſh upon the Tree, and is riſen on our behalf. I could write a Volume, had I words and time, of the terrible Inroads which the Enemy, eſpecially my own corrupt heart, makes upon me; but I doubt not, you know the ſame Warfare. What remains, but that with Faith, Hope, and Patience we cry out, <hi>How long, Lord, holy and true; how long ere the Canaanite be expelled, and theſe Thorns in our Fleſh be conſumed for ever?</hi> Oh what pure and uninterrupted Communion with Chriſt will that be, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin within, nor troubles and fears without ſhall gaul any more; when Melancholy, Doubts and Uu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as a black Cloud, ſhall be diſpelled, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for ever <hi>before the ſparkling face ef the Sun of Righteouſneſs, ſolemnizing the Marriage of his Spouſe.</hi> We have no Oratory that can out-paſs what he has already uttered concerning this, and his words are not vain, though ours are many times too too chaffy
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:109216:169"/> about theſe things, the more is the pity it ſhould be ſo. When he ſays, <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you: I will circumciſe your hearts to love me: I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem</hi> Jacob <hi>out of all his trouble: I will be with you, and deliver you,</hi> his words are all true; but our little exerciſe of Faith is either like a weak handed Gripe, or a leaky Veſſel; yet our Faith it ſelf is in his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his Interceſſion is inceſſant; and therefore it cannot utterly fail. Dear Siſter, wait on him, pluck up your Soul to the buſineſs; your labour will not be in vain, nor any unfaigned deſire after him return diſappointed and aſhamed. Throw Husband, Child, and ſelf upon him, into his Boſom; and there lodge together by Faith, in the Joy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and ſo take your reſt: I mean a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and yet a ſweet Reſt; for <hi>He gives his Beloved Sleep.</hi> His own Concernments are mixt in ours; though his own are chief in his eye, yet he can look upon them without beholding ours; for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made, and the Blood that concerns it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhed, and fully accepted; the Redemption compleat, and the Lord's portion and delight is his People. So that he (as it were, if I may ſay (as it were) in ſo true and real a buſineſs) raiſeth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an endleſs delight, by loving his ranſomed Seed, and in dreſſing them according to his own heart, and ſhedding out a meaſure of that Love into their hearts alſo, for carrying on a Spirit of Conjugal Affection in the Souls of his People towards him now; till the ſhadows ſlee away, and we come to know him, as we are known of him; and ſo love him without interruption, as we are loved of him. Is the day near when a thouſand fold more of this will really appear than words can utter? For who can ſpeak how much there lies in God's Purpoſe; yea, in his
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:109216:169"/> very heart, to do for them for whom he died, bought ſo dear, and reſcued with ſo high a hand? <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 15. How then ſhould we look out to awaken our faith, and lift up our heads, becauſe our Redeemer is alive and riſen, and our ſafety is in him? Oh that my own heart and yours were more warmed in ſuch a view.

Remember that God, even the Eternal Word, came, lived, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all Righteouſneſs, died, paid our Debts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved away the Curſe, and overcame in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for us, as our Mediator for us only, not for himſelf; he needed it not himſelf. Your nature and mine is as really in Heaven as our perſons are on Earth: and that Magazine is open to every deſiring and ſincerely hankering Soul. Our Redeemer is ſtrong, his heart tender, his words true, his Grace free, and his Love ſtrong as Death; his Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never fail. Oh let us love, fear, adore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; and in him alone lift up our heads. To him I commend you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Do not doubt but the ſame God who has made Communion with himſelf ſweet to you, will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you under his Wings, and perfect in you the good pleaſure of his Will.

               <p>AS for your Complaints, turn them into Prayer; and make the ſame Moan to Chriſt as you do to me: he has not only fellow-feeling, but can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour alſo. All other Friends can but adminiſter words; but he is not only willing, but able alſo to ſuccour them that come to him.

The more you expect from him, the more you get. The more you talk with him, the better you will be acquainted; and he loves ſuch Society. He is not harſh and ſtrange; but as a prudent Father and Husband, full of Bowels; and takes nothing ſo ill as your ſtanding aloof off.

               <p>I Do by one or other ſometimes hear of your health; which is welcome News to me. Although the years of my life have not reached the number that yours are now at, yet methinks the Lord hath given me a fair <hi>Reſpuit</hi> to ſeek that Pearl, which doth ſurmount the value of the whole World, and the Luſts thereof, which paſs away: but the deceit, pollution, and negligence of my own heart is ſuch, under a too ſhort improvement of time in a day of Grace, under the means thereof, that I may cry out, Where have I been? What have I done all this while? How little have I anſwered the Goſpel-Call? How little have I pried applyingly into the Myſtery of Chriſt? And what miſerable Returns have I made to all the bounteous offers of the Goſpel that I have read and heard? But yet the Lord hath in ſome part hinted to my Soul, that he has made with me in Chriſt an everlaſting Covenant. There I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire humbly to cling, and there to place all my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, my hope of Acceptation and Salvation, and all my deſire. And you that have ſeen more days than I have done, I intreat you alſo to give them a ſerious review. Let neither of us leave our choiceſt Concernments at uncertainties. Oh, for a rouzing viſit from the God of all Grace upon each
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:109216:175"/> of our hearts, that may alarm us out of our ſelves, into the City of Refuge before we are benighted. Let each of us be as much afraid to have any whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Conviction die upon us now, as we would be afraid hereafter to be found without our Wedding-Garment. I have little News but that the Plague is greatly increaſed, and ſeems to import that Wrath is gone forth. The Lord help us to put our houſe, our hearts in order, with the utmoſt zeal and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The Alarm from Heaven ſounds lowder and lowder, and ſeems to give more than an uncertain ſound: It ſpeaks out divine Wrath moſt apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; happy would this City and Land be, if it heard and ſubmitted to the voice of the Rod. Let us look out, and be fitted to meet our Lord. 'Tis pity to let an eternal ſtate be at uncertainties with us, when a temporal life is thus tottering. Such a flying to Chriſt as is accompanied with a clear Reſignation of our Wills wholly to his Will, is the beſt Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative for our Change.</p>

               <p>THough there is not often intercourſe betwixt us by Letters, yet I can truly ſay, you are many times upon my heart. The affairs of your precious and never-dying Soul is, as to you, the principal Theam of my anxious and affectionate remembrance of you. I have you in my eye when I do not bodily ſee you, and in my prayers to him who quickeneth all things, and giveth life and growth to whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he will. Your Convictions, your Temptations, inward and outward, the wiles and power of the Prince of Darkneſs, which ſtands againſt you in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:109216:175"/> Array; your infirmity, the deceitfulneſs of ſin, that will turn and wind, and ſhift from one corner of the Soul to the other, to preſerve it ſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſlodged; the lulling Baits, the powerful Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, the Threats, Exigences, and Influences of a preſent evil World; the difficulty, and yet the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of that ſpiritual Warfare, to which you are called, and unto which the promiſe of Victory is made: theſe things I ſay, are in my eye. And then I think there is matter enough for one Brother to remember another, and to cry out; O Lord, who ſhall raiſe my Brother into the vigorous exerciſe of faith with power, into inward and exemplary holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Who ſhall bring him into the Rivers of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Contrition, and land him on the right Shoar; for he is feeble, unable, and ready to halt in the way? Who ſhall bring him into the ſtrong City, the Walls whereof are Salvation, and the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof Purity, Serenity and Peace? Wilt not thou, O God, who alone canſt ſtay the crooked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſay to all obſtacles whatſoever, Give way; Let the ranſomed of the Lord return; Let the Seed of my Servants, to whom my Promiſe is made, come and enter into the ſtrong Hold; <hi>for I have found a Ranſom?</hi> Dear Brother, how, and in what frame of heart my Letter will find you, I know not; but God has guided my Pen, to let you know a little, what kind of muſings I have in my Jealouſie and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affection towards you. If you be buſie in theſe things already, theſe Lines may be Spur and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement: if otherwiſe, God can make them a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Alarm; though as mine, they are weak, ſhort, and impotent. I live here among the Graves, and do not know but that my deceaſe may be at hand, though at preſent in good health; and therefore I
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:109216:176"/> think meet to let my Arrow fly, as near as I can, to the White of the Mark; for there is no work nor invention in the Grave, there is no Return, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity to ſet the Houſe, the heart in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Though my glaunce may be at random, God can direct it within the Joynts of the Armour: To him I commend it and you. I have ſent you a Bill of Mortality.

Upon ſuch a Bottom as that, and no other, there is ſafe ſwimming by faith through all Changes and difficulties, unto a Condition of Reſt, Purity, Peace, and Satisfaction that will never change.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:109216:176"/> Concernments and mine in his own boſom, and take the whole care and guidance of us into his own hands, and alſo conform us perfectly to his Will; and then we are beyond hazard, and may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ſupplied ſufficiently; guided by his Grace here, and arrive at Glory hereafter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Lord is favourable to me; I have both the viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his favourable Frowns and Smiles, and his Frowns are very wholſome, for he never leaves me, nor breaks ſo much as one Clauſe of his Covenant; <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> I and my Family are in health; I may ſay, <hi>The Lord is my Shephard, I ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> Our God is a ſweet Portion, and Heaven a perfect Reſt: let us ſpring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and all will be well. Your condition is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſometimes ſolemnly preſented by us before the Lord, Who is a God hearing Prayer. 'Tis a comfort to me to think you are in his hands, and that he will aſſuredly guide you by his Counſel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he has brought you to Glory. I commend you to his care and kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Always perceive your friendly reſpect to me, for which I return you many thanks. As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of your Letter, there remaineth nothing on my thoughts that needeth any Apology from you; for I never found your Lines any other than
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:109216:178"/> the meer proceed of Integrity and entire Affection towards me, and therefore always very acceptable; and the rather becauſe they do not only leave Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon me, being privy to the burthen of mine own evil heart, I groan under; but are alſo by way of ſpur, a good and weighty motive to ſtir up my Soul to purſue the harder after that Mark which I ſhould, and do daily long to attain unto. Poor Worms as we are may hear and behold one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes with ſome moral and affectionate Impreſſions; but Oh, what an influential Object is Jeſus Chriſt, who when yearningly beheld, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Soul into the ſame likeneſs; and indeed, the Graces of his Spirit in his People alſo improved, through the Communication of the head, have great force through that Communication, to quicken one another. All this tends to exalt that Fountain of Life and Grace in Chriſt, that feeds all the Streams with its own vertue. And bleſſed be for ever the God of all Grace, that has called you and I into that glorious Fellowſhip and Communion. To him we may complain, and be pitied; in him we may boaſt, and can never exceed; there Affection may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed without danger, for he infinitely ſurmounts all our love, and all our praiſes: into whoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arms, my dar Friend, I commend you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:109216:178"/> The good and gracious God ſpread his Wing over you, and direct and manage your Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for you.

I can commend you to him as one whom he is pleaſed through Chriſt to own, within the rich, ſweet, and precious Covenant of his Grace; and whom he will care for, and never leave, till you are fully freed from every heart-oppreſſing care. Therefore in the midſt of all Cloudy Diſpenſations, rouſe up Faith, and ſo paſs through till you arrive at the Port of true Reſt, where the Fore-runner is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for you.

               <p>I Apprehend it a providential favour of God to me, who gave me an opportunity of ſeeing my dear Couſin, your Husband, before the Lord removed him hence; that I might have ſome freſh taſte of the frame of his Soul, when he ſtood upon the brink of Eternity, ready to lanch forth. I know it is an afflicting Providence to you, to be deprived of the Society of ſo dear a Relation, after you had ſo long enjoyed the Endearment of each others Affections, and had paſſed through many afflicting Diſpenſations together in this Vale of trouble; and had alſo, I doubt not, many joynt Applications to God, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:109216:179"/> together; and according to the ability which God gave, endeavouring to promote each others ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and everlaſting Welfare.

And now what remains, but that <hi>you gird up the Loyns of your Mind,</hi> to run the remainder of your own Race.

               <p>I Am loath to omit the giving you a Line or two by my dear Siſter, who is this Morning turning over one Leaf more of her wandring Pilgrimage. God is pleaſed ſo to order it, that (methinks) I can hear little from any of my dear Friends, but ſtories of worldly perplexity; and who are they, who are one way or other without their ſhare therein? This Life is like a troubleſome Dream; but bleſſed are they who, when once the Dream is out, and when once they come to awake, ſhall be ſatisfied with realities of true Peace and Comfort, in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Freedom and Goodneſs. We find our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and expectations here little better than a Bed of Thorns, becauſe this is not the Reſt that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the People of God: and 'twill be ſome help to us under this diſquieting exerciſe and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to remember that while we are paſſing through, we are held in the hand of him who has a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling of our Caſe; who did once paſs through the difficulties, and drank <hi>of the Brook in the way,</hi> but now <hi>lifts up his head,</hi> and ſo is become the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Hope; that ſuch poor Wretches as we are ſhall one day (<hi>through ſaith and patience</hi>) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive where <hi>our Fore-runner is entred.</hi> Only let us now cling upon him, till we become transformed into his Likeneſs, and be compleatly dreſſed with the <hi>white Robe of his Righteouſneſs;</hi> that in him, and only in him, we may be found without ſpot.

               <p>I Put you both together in my Letter, becauſe I have underſtood, that you are now no longer two, but one. I was very glad to hear that all your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Demurs had at laſt reſolved themſelves into a Conſummation of this long intended Union. My hearty deſire for you both is, that the Bleſſing and Guidance of the Lord may render your mutual So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety a real and conſtant Comfort to each other, and mutual advantage in reference to all Soul-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. There is no Condition in this World ſo deſirable, but is attended with Temptations and Trials: and therefore 'tis needful, as you have given your ſelves to each other; ſo alſo that you give up your ſelves particularly and joyntly, as Yoke-fellows together, unto the ſweet Yoak, and beleſſed Will of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. One of the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances that we find in Scripture, whereby the Love of Chriſt is ſet forth to Believers, is this ſtate of Marriage: And whatever Content therefore you find in this changed Condition, let it ſteer your thoughts to that glorious Myſtery of Chriſt's eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Nature, that we might become partakers of the Image of God in him; and long for that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of his, when the full ſolemnizing of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Marriage betwixt Chriſt and his Church will come, and the Union in all degrees be perfected.

You may ſee in ſhort, how
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:109216:181"/>
'tis with us at preſent, I need not add more, for I know what tender Love your ſelf did bear to this ſweet and heart-taking Infant. Only I deſire both you and my dear Siſter, and our Friends there to pray for us, that this ſtroak may be bleſt to us all, and that my deſolate dear Wife may be guided through her preſent Confuſion of Spirit, to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and right Refuge. I delivered her your Letter, which was very acceptable; and therefore pray write her ſomething again; and I deſire my Siſter would do the ſame. 'Tis good to help in time of need: Her heart is much broken, and my Affliction not a little; and I believe it is for ſome further good that God intends to us both: a few Lines from you, whom I know ſhe doth dearly value, will be very ſeaſonable. <hi>No Affliction is at preſent joyous, but grievous; but afterwards comes the ſweet and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Fruit:</hi> and this is the Portion of them who take hold of the full and ſure Covenant, and the crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed riſen Chriſt, who dies no more. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſo wean Affections hence, and from the miſchief of Creature-love, as the Study of Chriſt; viewing him in the Goſpel, pondering his excellent Perſon, and his glorious Mediatory Office for us; and ſo pitch the Affections on him, to be inflamed with his Love, in our own Propriety in him. And therefore not only with the Bowels of an Earthly Father, but in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt I intreat, and in his Name do charge you to ſtudy and muſe day and night, the unmeaſurable endleſs Love of God, who ſent his Son; the infinite, unwearied, and endleſs Love of Chriſt, who came, died, roſe again, and lives for ever to be your only Portion; and to make you, even you, a delightful Portion to him; and to render you (through the Blood of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:109216:181"/> Sprinkling, and the Communion and Influence of that one Spirit of the Father and Son) an Object of his Delight; and a Monument of his pardoning Grace, and his purifying Vertue to all Eternity. To him I commend you.</p>

               <p>BOth my ſelf and my Wife are very ſenſible of this ſore Storm with which the Lord is pleaſed to exerciſe your faith and patience at this time. But Chriſt is in the Veſſel, and therefore you cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: in the Fire and in the Water, in every cold and hot fit he is with you, and has a tender ſenſe of every jot of your pain and ſickneſs; tis a Father's Chaſtiſement and Trial: and all his aim is to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and fit you for an Object of his eternal delight. I know his everlaſting Arms are under you: and though the Diſpenſation be dark, yet he is doing you good with all his heart, according to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and with all his Soul. He enclined your heart of his own Grace to chuſe him, becauſe he choſe you firſt, and will yet chuſe you in the Furnace. Throw your ſelf upon him, for nothing ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you from his love in Chriſt. Chriſt himſelf was once ſick for your ſake, to the very death, and in great darkneſs; yet always beloved of his Father: and his God and Father is your God and Father; and therefore he will not forſake your Soul in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, but make your Bed in your Sickneſs; for his tender Mercy towards you can never dry up. Reſign up your ſelf to him, and be comforted in him; for he who is your own God and Saviour, is Lord both of Life and Death. My heart is melting
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:109216:182"/> over you, and yet I am but an earthly Father; all Affection is derived from him; but his Affections, his Love and Pity are infinite. I do remember you, and my poor Wife alſo; both of us have and do ſpread your Caſe before the Lord: and I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction in the Lord, that it is and will be well with you, living or dying; but we earneſtly deſire, if it be his Will, that you may yet live to ſhew forth the praiſes of him upon the Earth, who has done great things for you. For what greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour can he give a poor Creature, than to make you ſeek his Face, and to number you amongſt his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; which he has given Evidence of (bleſſed be his Name) already. Be not dejected, but lift up your head and heart to your God and Saviour: Throw all your ſins, and cares, and fears upon him, and ſpare not; for ſo you honour him, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleaſe him better. He ſees you through a Cloud, and delights to do you good; and will never ceaſe, till he open before you the endleſs Volume of his eternal Love, and ſo love you into his eternal Reſt. Therefore bear up, and be revived; for God himſelf is with you for a Refuge. To him I leave you, waiting his good pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The greateſt of earthly Contentments will be of no worth nor uſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; neither can they of themſelves, any way add to the Comfort or thriving of a ſpiritual Life here on Earth. The only Life we are allowed to live in this World is the Life of Faith; which grows bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under difficulties, than in a ſmooth ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in this World. I know no ſweeter Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God can give in this World to his poor Children, than that he give often Convincement that the beſt of this World is too lean Diet for them to feed upon; and ſo make them take the truer taſte of that Marrow and Fatneſs which in Chriſt, they are always to live upon; that is no leſs than God himſelf, the Fountain of Bleſſedneſs, Safety, Peace, Sufficiency, and ſolid Joy. What can come amiſs to that Soul, which Chriſt undertakes by all things, and through all things, to bring to himſelf? For this end he died; and this is the great end of every Trial you meet with; and upon this Ground the Spirit ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce when you fall into divers Temptations.</hi> All the Glory, Fulneſs, and Eaſe of this World is but horrour and diſtreſs to a convinced Soul, that looks on God as an Enemy: but nothing can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayingly

What ſhall I ſay? The freeneſs of God's Grace in Chriſt, his powerful and moſt voluntary Love is ſuch, where-ever it darts, that neither Sin nor Devil can ſtand before it, to hinder a jot of all that good which ſuch a God has promiſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to perform; and that meerly upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his own Name, ſtreaming forth through Chriſt in the Goſpel, to ſuch poor impenitent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as you and I are.

               <p>I Have heard by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> that you have been lately ſick, but yet recovering. I doubt not but you always wait and prepare for your Change; and are through Grace, ready for it.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:109216:189"/> is departed this Life, aged about ſeventy one years; his death greatly lamented by the People of God throughout this City. About the beginning of his Sickneſs I was with him, and he enquired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, as he was wont to do; and perceiving him to be ſomewhat weak, though he did not then keep his Chamber, I deſired him, while he was yet alive, to pray for you; which motion he chearfully and readily embraced. And coming to him again, about three days before his death, found him very weak, and paſt hope of life; he then told me, as well as I could underſtand him (for his Speech was low) that he had remembred his Promiſe to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you. I think good to mention this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paſſage, to provoke you to all ſeriouſneſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to your own Soul, whoſe eternal welfare lay ſo much upon the heart of this Servant of Chriſt. His Labours were great, his Studies inceſſant, his Converſation unſpotted, his Sincerity, Faith, Zeal, and Wiſdom gave a fragrant ſmell among the Churches and Servants of Chriſt. His Sickneſs, though painful, born with patience, and joy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; and ſo he parted from Time to Eternity, under full Sail of deſire and joy in the Holy Spirit. He lived his own Sermons: he did at laſt deſire his Friends to forbear ſpeaking to him, that ſo he might retire himſelf; which time they perceived he ſpent in Prayer; oftentimes lifting up his hands a little, and at length his Friends ſeeing not his hand to move, drew near, and perceived he was ſilently departed from them, leaving many mournful hearts behind. And now, dear Brother, Oh that this may be an exciting motive to you and I, to redeem the time which the Catterpillers have eaten, that we be not found unready. And if ever you expect to be a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109216:189"/> Companion again with Mr. <hi>Carrill,</hi> break off from all ſuch Company which were not his delight. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your ſelf to make a freſh and through Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to God in your old Age. Beg, I beſeech you, beg ſuch a Convincing impartial heart-breaking ſight of your ſins in Youth and old Age, that may force you to Chriſt for Refuge, while he may be found; and beg his Spirit, that you may glorifie him on Earth, the few days that yet remain, as ſignally as ever you have diſhonoured him. What a joy will it be to this glorified Saint, Mr. <hi>Carrill,</hi> at the laſt day, to ſee that his Prayers for you have prevailed. Dear Brother, I pray excuſe my earneſtneſs in what I have written, It may be you and I may never ſee each other in this World: you are much upon my heart, I mean as to your eternal Eſtate; and glad I ſhould be to hear of ſome eminent Change as to Soul-Concernments, before either I hear of yours, or you hear of my lanching forth into vaſt Eternity, where there can be no more Changes; and the hour is near, in which the eye that hath ſeen you, ſhall ſee you no more: <hi>As the Tree falls, ſo ſhall it lie;</hi> the eternal Judgment follows Death at the Heels. I can ſay no more; it muſt be Divine Power and Grace that muſt ſet the Wheels a going, if ever they move. And therefore, whilſt I am in this World, I hope I ſhall not ceaſe to pray for you, whilſt you are in this World alſo; for our Prayers cannot reach beyond the Grave. Dear Brother, farewel; yea, fare better and better, till you fare beſt of all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Bleſs the Lord, I can remember and mention you as one who is intereſted in that Promiſe, <hi>Jer. 32. 41. I will rejoyce over them, to do them good:</hi> and that he will never leave you, till he has perfected that which concerns you, in a way of Grace, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Love. My great and often Requeſt on your behalf is, above all, that God would preſerve you from the Evil of Sin, and from Snares in your daily Walk; that he would ſprinkle you with the Blood, with the Merit of Chriſt's Satisfaction and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; that he would direct your Path, and do all your Works in you, and for you; and cauſe you to lean ſtrongly and chearfully on the Arm of his Truth and Grace, in reference to all preſent and future Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and that you may more than conquer through
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:109216:191"/> believing, in every Exigence you do or may meet with; till the Warfare be accompliſhed, and the days of Trial finiſhed, in the Fruition of perfect Freedom. For my own part, I have reaſon to bleſs the Lord, that he has favourably held me up, and carried me along now theſe many years, ſince we ſaw each other, though exerciſed me with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and conſiderable Loſſes; yet I hope, and do think, he has ſome way or other a Reſerve of Kindneſs for me (unworthy me) and mine; <hi>for the Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs of it.</hi> And through this Grace I have in ſome meaſure and deſire, held on ſtill to chuſe him for my Portion, as to things preſent and eternal. As his time was (writing of one deceaſed) ſo your and my times are in the hands of God, who is moſt wiſe, and to be adored and ſubmitted to. The days of our anxious Pilgrimage are running out; the Lord direct our eyes to that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene unchangeable State, where Sins, Fears, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, Turmoils, and Difficulties will ceaſe for ever: To the Care, Counſel, Comfort, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of whoſe gracious Spirit I commend you.</p>

               <p>I Have not received any Letter from you for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Weeks, which is not a little afflictive. You are upon our hearts, and we ceaſe not the particular mention of you in our Prayers. Sometimes I fear your Body lies under ſuch extremity that you cannot write; and ſometimes I am willing to relieve my thoughts by ſuppoſing, if it were ſo, I might at leaſt, have a Letter from <hi>S. H.</hi> But though I know not your preſent Caſe, yet I know my God and your God has you under his own Love and Care: His great deſign for his own Glory, and your and my Good, is to inſtruct us, and lead us into the Life of Reſignation, and Dependance ſingly and fully upon himſelf: ſaving Light, Faith, and Truth is the very Leſſon he is calling upon me, and drawing me to own; and Oh for ſome good Proficiency in this Learning: nothing ſo ſweet, nothing ſo ſecure, and nothing ſo compleatly advantagious. I left the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>J.</hi> this Afternoon, very near, in appearance, to a Diſſolution, and <hi>A. P.</hi> breathing, and waiting for her Change.

To the Shadow of whoſe Wing I commend both you and my Siſter, longing to hear of her Recovery, if the Lord pleaſe; but ſhe is in a Fathers hand, and under her Fathers care and love: in Sickneſs and Health, living and dying, nothing can come amiſs to thoſe that love him, and ſell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perfectly away to him; as I am perſuaded ſhe has done; and can rejoyce in that bleſſed Bargain. A Contract made by and through Chriſt, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs, and watchful prevalent Advocate; and however outward Diſpenſations and Providences do work, they will work together for good, becauſe his Love, Mercy, and Truth endureth for ever; where the Eye of his Favour once fixeth, he never takes it off; the tokens of which Favour you have, through his free Grace, had ſome taſte of, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may be led, and helped to hope perfectly to the end, and humbly rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of God, in what method ſoever he is pleaſed to act in the way of his fatherly Diſcipline.

               <p>IN my laſt I acquainted you of the weakneſs of my, Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> at which time ſhe continued with an intermixing of Revivings now and then, and much refreſhment as to the ſtate of her Soul, and things eternal; and in the Doctor's Opinion, in ſome good hope of Recovery, until the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inſtant <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> being the Sabbath Day: and then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſaw that the Lord had determined otherwiſe, and that Evening he called her to himſelf.

It is your own Affliction, that you are by the Providence of God, held there ſo long, at that diſtance from us, under ſo many Trials of your Faith and Patience on every hand; which as the Lord is pleaſed to help, I am with my weak meaſure, often preſenting before him, that he would bear up your heart, and aſſiſt you as he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done, to go through the reſidue of your Exerciſe in this Pilgrimage.

And as to any Counſel that I am able to give you, 'tis far ſhort of what you do or may receive; not only from the ſolemn Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Goſpel, by the faithful Diſpencers of the Word, but alſo by thoſe excellent Books, fit for Meditation, Uſe, and Application; of which I ſuppoſe you have many lying by you. Only I would ſay this; The chiefeſt part of Religion (that which in Scripture is called the Kingdom of God) lies chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart-renewing Power; whereby the Throne and Dominion of Sin is broken with daily Warrings againſt it, and daily labouring to be free from its Captivity; and to that end there is a neceſſity of the Conviction of our ſinful (yea, damnable) Condition by Nature: and that not only in our own Opinion and Judgment, but in real view, ſenſe, feeling, and inward Operation and Exerciſe; that ſo the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:109216:195"/> of, and Intereſt in Chriſt may appear indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly neceſſary, and perfectly deſirable, as a <hi>Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for Sin,</hi> and to tranſlate the Soul into the pure Image of himſelf in this World, as the Fore-runner of an eternal Fruition of all that Bleſſedneſs he died to purchaſe. And upon manifold Conſiderations, it doth eminently concern you to dig for this Wiſdom, as for hid Treaſure. You have and may further ſee what a lean ſatisfaction it is, that this lower World doth afford; what a Sandy Foundation it is to build our hope, delight, or dependance upon; and how ſoon every Flower withers. Therefore daily beg of God Light, Truth in the inward part, and ſaving Wiſdom, to be your Principle and Guide, through the reſidue of Time. Unto his Grace I commend you, and reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Received your Letter, and delivered that you ſent my Brother: both he and I are ſenſible of the loſs of your only Brother. It doth concern you to conſider the Voice of God in theſe Afflictions, one after another; and to improve them ſo as to make God himſelf in Chriſt your only ſtanding Refuge. And certainly, if theſe things do cauſe you to turn your eyes directly upon him, and to centre in him alone, you will find him <hi>the Husband of the Widow, and Father of the Fatherleſs.</hi> In every trouble our wiſeſt courſe is, to endeavour to learn what God is pleaſed to ſay to our Souls therein; which is to get the hearts of his People more united unto himſelf by Faith and clear Reſignation; for though the things and Perſons of this World do wither and fade, yet God himſelf
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:109216:196"/> is the Rock of Ages; and hath promiſed, <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not be utterly deſolate:</hi> for in the Fire and in the Water he will be with them, and never leave or forſake them. And therefore I would deſire you to endeavour, rather to improve your Affliction by Faith for ſpiritual uſe, than to waſte away your thoughts unprofitably through Unbelief, in ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dejecting your heart under theſe outward Trials, though they be great. Therefore read and meditate the Word, where proviſion of Support is made, to anſwer all Caſes of diſtreſs. Spread your Soul often before the Lord; open the bottom of your heart to him. Fly to the Blood of Chriſt for daily Atonement; and give your ſelf up to him who has ſaid, <hi>Caſt your burthen on the Lord, and he will ſuſtain you:</hi> and then you will ſee reaſon at length to ſay, <hi>It was good for me that I was afflicted;</hi> and that <hi>He or ſhe is bleſſed whom God afflicts, and teacheth his</hi> Law.

               <p>I Often think upon you; and look upon it as a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing of God towards you, not only to prolong your Life to this Age, but alſo, and chiefly, that he hath crowned your old Age with an unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Tendency towards a better Life than you or I have ever yet ſeen, with that Sight which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here be capacious of. I do hear ſometimes by one or other, both of your being in the Land of the Living, and that you walk as becomes an aged Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt; adorning the Goſpel you profeſs with a Converſation ſuitable thereunto. The laſt time I heard from you was by our good Friend Mrs. <hi>Stubs,</hi> who was here but a few days before her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that holy and laborious Miniſter of Chriſt, took his leave of her; breathing forth his laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to this preſent World: and that Body of Clay in which he had ſerved Chriſt, for gaining of Souls into his Flock, through a long Tract of years, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing (I hope proſpering) in the great Embaſſage which the great Shepherd employed him in. His death was much bewailed by many, eſpecially by
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:109216:197"/> them that beſt knew his Worth, as a great loſs to the Intereſt and Cauſe of Chriſt, both in City and Country. The Lord in Mercy raiſe up more Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of like Sincerity, Diligence, and Faithfulneſs in the Lord's Vineyard. Dear Couſin, the Lord is pleaſed to uſe many ways and means to cauſe us to make the utmoſt improvement of Seaſons and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Grace, and gives many Motives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; amongſt which this is one, that the Prophets do not live for ever; and therefore he requires us to make ſpeed, while the day of Grace, and while the time of Life continues; that we may not be found naked and unready, when our Summons from hence by Death ſhall be ſent us. I have not arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the length of your days, but the effects of old Age are much upon me, and the ſhadows of the Evening have begun to appear; therefore, as it is always, ſo eſpecially it is needful for you and I, that are almoſt at the utmoſt bounds of our time. to look into, and much to ſtrive after the real and eſſential parts of Godlineſs; which lies much in this, <hi>viz.</hi> To ponder the Corruption of our own Nature, and the Contradiction that it ſtands in, againſt the pure Nature of God, and his revealed Will; till we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſuch a Self-Abhorrence, and Diſpondence of any Relief which we can derive from whatever we are, or whatever we can do, as of our ſelves; that we may betake our ſelves entirely and perfectly to the Grace revealed in Chriſt; caſting our Anchor of Hope there, and there only; flying to the Merits of Chriſt, and his ſingle Righteouſneſs; in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and under the Covering whereof, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, when all Fleſh ſhall ſtand and receive their unalterable Sentence: that then we may have the comfortable Happineſs of that good Word, <hi>There is
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:109216:197"/> no Condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt.</hi> I cannot at preſent add more, only this; Let none of your paſt or preſent Troubles, of what kind ſoever, hinder your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in your gracious God and Saviour, who hath fed you all your Life long; and will be your God, and your Guide; and (as I am abundantly perſuaded) you will find him, according to all that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, your exceeding great Reward, when the days of Reſt and endleſs Refreſhing ſhall come. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to the gracious Guidance of God, and the comfortable Fellowſhip and Communion of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit. I pray for you, and deſire to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred alſo by you, in your Prayers unto the <hi>God of all Grace; even our own God and Father:</hi> Under whoſe Wing I deſire to leave you, and remain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>GOd has been pleaſed to continue your Life unto a great length of days; and though your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man hath been withering (yet, bleſſed be God, I perceive) your inward Man hath been aſſiſted by his good Spirit hitherto, to make a happy Voyage to the Haven of true Reſt. The Lord in Mercy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you through the remaining part of your Voyage, till you enter ſafely into the Harbour, and be ſetled in the Manſions which Chriſt is gone before to prepare for you. I have my ſelf much Infirmity of Body, and am in daily Combat with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Vileneſs of my own heart; from which I hope, through the Riches of free Grace, to be ere long delivered: and I have an abundant hope, as to the ſame concerning your ſelf. Caſt your eye upon the great Mediator, roll your ſelf upon him; for he
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:109216:198"/> will never leave you, nor forſake you. One days Communion with God without all Sin, in that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country, will make you full amends for all the difficulties you have paſſed through in your earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pilgrimage. And though I am not like to ſee you in this World, I hope, through the Grace of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, to ſee you where there will be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sin nor old Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to moleſt either you or me any more. Dear Couſin, the Arms of Divine Love, Grace, and Mercy be continually embracing you. I can now add no more; but do commend you into the hands of that God, whoſe I am perſuaded you are, and whom you ſerve. My affectionate Reſpects to your ſelf, and all your Relations, and that Seed of God which he hath been pleaſed to plant in your Neighborhood. I remain, your affectionate Kinſman, and Brother in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Speeches</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> of Mr. <hi>Henry Dorney,</hi> in his laſt Sickneſs, from the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1682 / 3. to the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> following; when he died: being the Seventieth Year of his Age.</head>
            <p>I Am paſſing, and I long to paſs (meaning through Death.) O Faith, Faith, that would bring down Heaven to Earth, and carry the Soul up to Heaven.</p>
            <p>I would willingly go out of Self, and place the Soul wholly in God; he calls me to come away, ſaying, <hi>Come up hither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To a Friend, asking whether Satan troubled him; he anſwered, No, not at all; Chriſt doth not ſuffer him ſo much as to peep in.</p>
            <p>To the ſame, ſaying, What Counſel would you give us? His Anſwer was, Give up your ſelves to God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Walk in the pureſt, ſtricteſt, cloſeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him. Be in the Life and Power of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and that will Steel the Soul againſt all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and Difficulties. And let things be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted throughly betwixt God and the Soul, as if you were to appear preſently at the Bar of Chriſt. And let this be done inceſſantly.</p>
            <p>To the ſame again, asking; Sir, God ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Bleſſing upon the Means for your Recovery, and you are not like to continue long with us: He replied, Bleſſed be the Lord, Bleſſed be the Lord;
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:109216:199"/> It is ſome Refreſhment to me to think that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Minute of my ſliding off is ſo near at hand. The Saints and People of God that ever lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> paſs'd through Death, and it is needful it ſhould be ſo; for then all Dirt and Filth will be carried off.</p>
            <p>And to one ſpeaking to him of a good Conſcience, he ſaid, Ah, how many are there that are now lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Matter, that will be one day wringing of hands, and diſtreſs of heart unto them. O my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable God, bleſſed be his Name that ever he treated with me; and that he gave me time and Grace to tranſact things betwixt him and me; and though now I can do little, I am perſuaded he loves me, becauſe he hath made me to love him. I have received a Sentence of Death in my ſelf, and I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquieſce in God's Will therein; yet if it pleaſe him that I ſhould live any longer, I deſire it may be with greater Spirituality, and more in the Life and Power of Holineſs: for I would not live one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longer than that I may ſignifie ſomething; for in the Caſe I am in, I ſignifie very little. I am in Deaths often, and which will be the concluding one I know not.</p>
            <p>He farther took occaſion to complain of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and unedifying Walk of Chriſtians, their not preſſing on to ſpiritual things, their not ſavouring of the things of God when they meet one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; exhorting them that were then preſent, that they would more value Converſe with ſuch as are truly Godly: For, ſaid he, if I am of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I ſhould value the Society of thoſe of the ſame Country. As, when I was in <hi>France,</hi> when I ſaw an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, I preſently fell in with him, and was glad to diſcourſe him of the things relating to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:109216:199"/> our own Country. Now thoſe that obey the high Goſpel-Call, they enter into another Country; out of the Power of Satan, into Chriſt's Kingdom; and their Converſe ſhould be with reſpect to their glorious Country: and that there ought to be open-heartedneſs in the Spirit of Grace, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of ſome good thing, when and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they meet with each other. And with reſpect to a particular Congregation, he prayed for them, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord keep them in the Faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and in a mighty Union one with another; and that they may have God's Appearance in his own Power, to keep that Limb of Chriſt alive, ſaved from Diviſion and Pollution, have Wiſdom and Truth in the inward parts, that they may be a ſweet Bundle unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 16. To one that came to viſit him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to weep, but preſently checked himſelf, ſaying; Theſe are not the Tears of Grief, but of Weakneſs and Debility; or rather, Tears of Joy. I am very ſick, but I have no ſorrow. I would be uncloathed, that I might be cloathed upon, that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life. And Oh that it might be now, now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 17. To one ſaying to him, Sir, you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heaven before us; which will be your gain, but our loſs: He reſponded, If my gain thereby were not a thouſand times more than your loſs, it were an inconſiderable thing, the Change which the Scripture ſpeaks of; but however, <hi>My God will ſupply all your needs, Phil.</hi> 4. 19. He further ſaid, I am as a Tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veller, that ſees my Home a little before me; which makes my Evening a ſweet Morning to me. To one taking leave of him, he ſaid, The Lord's Bleſſing be upon you; we here take leave one of another, but
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:109216:200"/> ſhortly there will be no more taking leaves; and the next Viſit, on the other ſide of the Voyage, will be with another kind of Luſtre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 19. He deſired that <hi>Job 14 ch.</hi> and <hi>Iſa. 32 ch.</hi> might be read to him; which being done, he ſaid, I am going toward the Bars of Death, bleſſed be the Lord; yet a little while, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And demanding what of the Clock it was? It being told him, ſaid; How ſlow do the hours paſs? I ſpeak as one that would fain have time to paſs; I would fly out of Time. And to another, ſpeaking of the Joys of Heaven he was drawing near unto; he ſaid, I would be in them, I would be in them. To a Friend that was to watch with him that night, he ſaid, You are come to give me your helping hand, your Chriſtian hand, at the going over the laſt Style; I thank you: I know that there is a Glory that will follow this Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March.</hi> 20. He then ſpake, ſaying, The Grave is ready for me, and I for it, bleſſed be God; and Oh, with what welcome is it to me? How do I delight in it? Oh, <hi>the General Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in Heaven; and God, the Judge of all, and the Spirits of Juſt Men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect, that I am going to be with.</hi> Chriſt hath ſtopp'd the Mouth of the roaring Adverſary (meaning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan) that he doth not encumber me in the leaſt; and though I have the ſame matter within me as others have, yet Chriſt holds him faſt, that he hath no power at all to trouble me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 21. Speaking to a Friend, he ſaid, I am like one hurrying towards the <hi>Head-Quarters;</hi> I long vehemently to be gone out of this preſent ſtate, and that God would ſay unto me, <hi>Come away, Come away, Come up hither.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 22. In the Morning he deſired <hi>Joh. 3 ch.</hi> to be read; and at thoſe words concerning the Change of a new born Soul, he ſaid, There lies the Touch. And at the two laſt verſes, he ſaid, There is the Clinch. After that, he proceeded to ſpeak to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> Ever ſince the Lord, in his free Grace, took hold of my heart, I have had a ſincere Reach after him, and a Love to him, and I have not dallied with him. I have in ſome meaſure walked before him in truth, now theſe ſcores of years; and he hath made me to find no eaſe, nor to take any reſt any where but in himſelf, and in being near to him; and what I have done all along, hath been in truth, and with an upright heart. God and I, we were both agreed; he mine, and I his; his Concerns I took to be my Concerns, and mine were his; and I could never take Content in any thing but in him; I could get no comfort in any Duty, in any Prayer, in any Ordinance, but in getting nigh to him, in reſigning up my ſelf to him, in cloſing with him, and in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my Soul brought over to his Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 24. He ſaid, I know the Lord minds me, I can do but little, but yet I love him.</p>
            <p>1683. <hi>March</hi> 26. He ſaid, What a poor pitiful thing is a dying Creature? There is no Death in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; one good lift would ſet me free from all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 27. Then he ſaid, I am uſeleſs, as one out of the World; I cannot manage thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 31. Finding himſelf very weak, he ſpake, ſaying, Thus a poor Life expires, bleſſed be God; I am as an Hireling, drawing towards the Evening of the day. What ſhall I ſay? When, when, when, when? With his eyes looking upwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 3. He ſaid thus, I have layen ſo many days and ſo many nights, and the days have been even as
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:109216:201"/> nights to a poor dead thing; but I believe all is in love, in tender love. I have been taught in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel God's free Grace in Chriſt, and I faſten and cling on that, which is all I can do. I languiſh in pain: here are all the tokens of a Diſſolution, and yet no Diſſolution; and how long the Lord may continue me thus, I know not, but the Lord is wiſe.</p>
            <p>To ſome Friends near him he ſaid, I deſire you to pray to the Lord for me, that he would give me a fit meaſure of ſuitable Grace; and that he would preſerve and continue it. I earneſtly deſire you to pray that I may be preſerved ſo as to do nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming my dear Lord. Then he proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſay, Chriſt will loſe none of his; he will ranſack Heaven and Earth, rather than any one of his ſhall miſcarry; yea, it will pain him to loſe any part of his Fleſh. I have been like <hi>Jonah,</hi> in the Whales Belly, now for many days. Again he ſaid, Chriſtians are never more like themſelves, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, than when they are in Converſe about ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, things above; and there are no Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be compared with ſpiritual Relations. After that he ſaid, The Lord hath poſtured my Body unfit for the Means applied for its Cure. To one ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, Sir, you are going to a <hi>bleſſed Eternity;</hi> and what would you have us to do in this wicked World? He replied, <hi>Get into a holy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 5. He expreſſed himſelf thus; I ſhall have liberty, I ſhall have liberty; Good, good, good is the Lord: Theſe things will have an end, they will have an end. After that he would have <hi>Joh. 4. ch.</hi> read to him; which, when read, ſaid, <hi>The Lord help me to ponder it.</hi> After which, he would have <hi>Joh. 5. ch.</hi> read; <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>all is good News:</hi> which, when read, he deſired in like manner the <hi>6th</hi> Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:109216:201"/> to be read over; after which he ſpake thus, Here we ſee what a great deal of work our Lord did in a little time, and take him for your Example: Be nimble in your actings in getting him to be yours. You ſee the Caſe of a dying Friend: I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to live Jeſus Chriſt, and to be found in him, both in Life, and in Death. I deſire that you (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Friends ſtanding about him) will make it your Requeſt, that I may never be aſhamed of my Hope, and that I may have an abundant Entrance given me <hi>into the everlaſting Kingdom:</hi> and the like I pray for all the new born of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 11. He ſpake to a Friend near him thus; There wil be huge doings ſhortly; God will be known as he is. Pray look up to God, that I may have ſome diſtinct thoughts in Conſideration; ſuch as may be profitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 13. He ſaid, I have none but thy ſelf, O Lord; How long, how long?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 14. In the Afternoon he groaned ſomething much in his Sleep; and awaking, ſaid, I have had ſome trouble in my Spirit. This dogged Enemy (meaning Satan) would make me very wretched, and ſo I am. Upon which one by him replied, 'Tis recorded in Scripture, <hi>My Covenant will I not break, &amp;c.</hi> And he ſaid, I know he will not: but this Enemy is ſo dogged, that when I begin to fix my thoughts on any good thing, he endeavours to diſturb me, that I cannot maintain my Communion with God as I would. To <hi>D. P.</hi> his Phyſician; telling him that God ſeemed now to be taking of him away; he preſently replied, Bleſſed be his holy Name, he leaves me not; and he will never leave me. And he further ſaid to him, I thank you for all your great kindneſs; the Lord return it you, giving you in his
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:109216:202"/> very heart. After that, ſaid, I have heard and read much of Death, and the Attendants of it; and now I come to experience the very thing it ſelf, even what that great Change is. To another dear Friend he ſpake thus, It would be a great ſight to ſee two mighty Angels make a buſtle together, having equal Aſſiſtance on the one ſide, and on the other: But what will it be to ſee the God of Angels ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all his glorious Retinue in Battel Array? This ere long will be ſeen; and the Goſpel will not be handled only in Pulpits as now, but the Glory of it will ſhine far and near; filling the whole World with its Luſtre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 15. In the Morning he uttered himſelf thus, I lie at eaſe, and my Soul ſhall dwell at eaſe. If the Lord would have me to be the laſt Man that ſhould ſuffer in this World, I would, through his divine Grace and Help, willingly ſubmit to his Will therein. However, if it might be, I have an earneſt longing to have now a Caſt given me into the other World. In the Afternoon of that day, about two of the Clock, he began, as was obſerved, to ſpeak more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and with ſuch an even audible Voice, that it was noted down <hi>verbatim</hi> as he ſpoke, <hi>viz.</hi> Oh, how good is it to get into God. How good is it to have all the terms of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> ratified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Soul.</hi> Lord, let thy Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be my <hi>Lodging,</hi> my <hi>Delight,</hi> my <hi>Joy;</hi> let me have <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>intimate</hi> Communion with thee. Thou haſt called me, O Lord: I come to thee, O Lord, I come to thee; let all the Grace promiſed to thy People in this paſſage be given to me. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are many, Vanities are many; away with them, becauſe Chriſt came to remove all Vanity, to remove all Sin. Oh let thy Truth, let the Sealing
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:109216:202"/> of thy Word be to my Soul as refreſhing Waters of Life. Oh for ſolid Acquaintance with thee, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Communion with thee, as between Father and Son; as between thee, and one that is thy Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of thee, now at the end of all things; Oh, ſhine forth. Temptations will be working whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can; Now, Lord, glorifie thy abounding Grace; Now, O Lord, let the Grace of Chriſt ſhine like a <hi>burning Lamp:</hi> Now let me be as one climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the top of the Mount. Be with me, and with them I leave behind; and let them be found in thee in the day of Chriſt. And Oh, let the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Greatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Solemnity</hi> of ſpiritual things be kept up in the World; and let Chriſt reign, and be very conſpicuous, and his People alſo, and let him ſave his Church, and redeem it: Be with all thine. I cannot pray as I ſhould: But wilt thou who <hi>openeſt the mouth,</hi> and <hi>filleſt the heart;</hi> wilt thou who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thine own Mind and Will; wilt thou accompliſh all the deſigns of thy Grace to thy own Glory, and fulfil the deſires of all that fear thee, and all in Chriſt?</p>
            <p>My own God, my own God; and may I have no other God but thee. My graciosu God, now be with me. Lord, what thou doſt mean, reveal it to me in thy good time, and let me be ſignificant for thee ſome way. Here I am even bound up, having no ſtrength, no capacity. If I be for another World, reveeal thy Mind. Now I am incapacitated, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think thoughts conſiſtent one with another; I am as one in a great part dead all the while I live: But, Lord, let me be a <hi>living Server</hi> of thee, who wilt have <hi>living Service</hi> from all thine. O Lord, be the <hi>Conductor,</hi> the near Conductor of them I leave behind me. Carry my <hi>Yoak-fellow</hi> in thine own Arms, and our <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> with her; and be with my graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:109216:203"/> Friends thou haſt made to tender me; and let them be glorious in this World in Holineſs, and be bound up with thee for ever in the Covenant of Grace, into which thou haſt called them. Let my poor Friends that have loved me, and have ſeen but little Grace; ſomething it may be, they have ſeen, through thy Goodneſs; Oh be with them, and make them grow abundantly. Let thy Glory ariſe, haſten it; let the Kingdom of Chriſt be exalted. Oh that the days of this Darkneſs may be blown away; and let there be a mighty coming in of <hi>Truth, Holineſs, Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Light</hi> and <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> that there may be a mighty Child-like Spirit in all thy Children. I deſire all theſe Petitions in truth. Let thy People be the Wiſdom, the Truth, the Joy of the Earth. Be with me, and be with all thine; and this I beg in the Lord Jeſus. Let thy good Spirit come upon all thine; Oh, glorifie thy ſelf now and ever. Oh, let thy good Will be done; Oh, let thy own Will be done: Let my Will follow thy Will, as the <hi>Thread</hi> follows the <hi>Needle;</hi> and let it be ſo eternally. Let my Soul believe every word that thou haſt ſpoken ſhall be accompliſhed. Thou wilt never leave till thou haſt made thy Name <hi>conſpicuous,</hi> and all thy People <hi>rejoyce.</hi> Oh why, why, why may not the ſlow coming on now make haſte? Oh, why may not the Growth of ſpiritual Wiſdom be ſprouting forth with great Improvement, as being the very Operation of the Spirit? Why may not Love to thee come and damp all other Loves? Why may not the Obſervation of thy Love thou ſheweſt me be powerful, and transforming of my Soul? Why ſhould I lie back? Lord, I am not ſanctified at the rate thou uſeſt means for the ſame. Oh, that I might have more of the Spirit; much, much more;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:109216:203"/> and may ſee the Power of God from Heaven migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily changing me. Oh, let not thy Spirit be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Oh, let Truth and Power be given in. O God, fill the World with thy Spirit; that thy work may be done <hi>tidily, tidily.</hi> Oh, let there be a nearneſs between thee, and the Souls of thy People. Oh that never that dull Spirit in Religion may come into the World again, a God-provoking Temper of Soul. Oh, that thy People may judge of their love to thee by the very Out-goings of their Souls to thee; and account nothing a Token of Love to thee, unleſs the Soul be, as it were, in ſome <hi>Surprizes</hi> of being thine, joyned to thee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; as if it were about to be carried out of the World. I have been a withered, dry Branch; Oh haſten a <hi>Spring-time</hi> in one World or another. Thou haſt given me <hi>Truth in the inward parts,</hi> I bleſs thee; but there is no Anſwer anſwerably. I wait now, I wait every day and every night; a poor Waiter I am: O Lord, be found; Oh, let God be glorified. Oh that I might ſee Religion to be ſomething. I have profeſſed Religion ſcores of Years, one after another; and yet to have got no more of the Glory of the Grace of that Religion (methinks) doth import, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath a ſtrange debilitating power; but God is pleaſed to leave him, to put a ſlur upon the Glory of Chriſt's Church in the Life of Grace, and to make the ways of God ſeem not ſo exceeding diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the way of Fleſh as it is; and all this for <hi>Trial,</hi> and all this for <hi>Shame,</hi> when the eyes of the ſpiritual Mind be a little opened. Oh, when a little ſatisfaction is got, that there is truth of Grace, how doth a ſeduced Soul nuzzle it ſelf in that, that it is ſafe; and doth not make out for a great Progreſs in Grace and Holineſs. And if God ſhould leave that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:109216:204"/> Soul at laſt, under thoſe terrible Trials that may ariſe from thence, it may ſhake, and put it into a terrible Conſternation. Alas, never can I fly <hi>too far</hi> from that devouring Lion; never can I fly <hi>too ſoon.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 16. Ah ſweet Grave, where I ſhall not need any cooling Drink. Being ſpoken to from a near Friend, <hi>viz.</hi> I hope the Lord will give you in, of himſelf, ſome ſuch Proſpect as he did to <hi>Stephen,</hi> when he was leaving the World: He replied, <hi>I have a little ſight of him,</hi> and <hi>I find no dark paſſage to the enjoyment of him.</hi> To another Friend he ſaid, He that hath you by the hand will never leave you. To a near Relation he ſpake thus; Say to your Soul, I have a Fountain that will never dry up. <hi>My Lines are fallen to me in a pleaſant place; yea, I have a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heritage.</hi> There ſhould be frequent fondneſſes between God and us, as Children towards their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. He farther declared, that though he had an earneſt deſire to be gone hence, yet if the Lord pleaſed, he could be content and willing to be the laſt Man in the Brunt of Suffering for his ſake and Name in this World; or words to that effect. Again he ſpake, ſaying, O Lord, <hi>come quickly, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> anſwer me by thy ſelf. My wiſe God is ſtill pleaſed to continue me, though there are no ſigns of a Reſerve for further Service to him in this World. I bleſs the Lord for his Goodneſs towards me. The Conſolation of God is no ſmall thing; it is no ſmall thing, it is ſtrong Conſolation; the Conſolation of Chriſt is a great thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April.</hi> 17. A Friend taking his leave of him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was going to viſit a Perſon of Honour, he ſpake to this effect; Pray remember me to my Lord; and tell him that I am an Expectant, hoping for a Meeting where we may dwell for ever.</p>
            <pb n="375" facs="tcp:109216:204"/>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 18. In the Morning he ſpake, ſaying, O Lord, how do I paſs through nights and days? O wiſe God, and doſt thou (ſpeaking to himſelf) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him ſo? Lord, make me to account thee wiſe; and good Lord, pardon me, and receive me. O happy day that is coming; O bleſſed day that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I paſs through <hi>Death,</hi> unto <hi>eternal Life.</hi> After that he ſaid, The Captive ſhall return, there will be no Captivity. O ſweet Redemption! Much of our Heaven here lies but in a little talk about it; and when we ſpeak a word of it, we have ſcarce a Thought ſuitable to the greatneſs of it. Some ſpace after he fetch'd a deep Groan; and with his eyes lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and his Right hand ſtretched forth (as if the pains of death were upon him) he ſaid, <hi>Sharp and welcome, Sharp and welcome.</hi> And a while after he ſaid, praying; Lord, let me not die with any Guilt upon me; but leave it all behind. Oh, let not any Sin remain in me unrepented of. Let not any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the leaſt Guilt be in me. Let there be upon my Will an edge of Hatred againſt every Sin: Create it in me now. Thou canſt make me to delight in that that is contrary to my own Will. Oh let thy Will be pleaſing to me, and let my Will be every way according to thy Will. Let not the <hi>Agonies</hi> of Death be too <hi>terrible;</hi> let not the <hi>Surge</hi> of it be too <hi>terrible</hi> to me, nor to any of the Race thou haſt redeemed from Death. Let the <hi>Agonies</hi> of Death be pleaſing to me in Chriſt. Oh the <hi>Dolour,</hi> the unſpeakable <hi>Anger</hi> of God: we have not drank of it. O the intollerable <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, born by that Man (meaning Jeſus Chriſt.) O the woful <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> of Chriſt: we have took up but a little of it; and that hath made Repentance ſlight, and holy Care trivial. And now, O Lord, thou reckoneſt with me,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:109216:205"/> for undervaluing of that <hi>bloody Agony:</hi> Lord, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me my Guilt in this thing. I have not been a Chriſtian in earneſt as I ought. Oh he that made himſelf the <hi>bottom of all ſorrow,</hi> he ſuffered infinitely, Oh ſuch a Redeemer, Oh ſuch a Redeemer; alas, how unſuitable have I been to him. Lord, pardon my unſuitableneſs; I have been as a Beaſt before thee: I have not come up to anſwer the Call of that unutterable Grace. And now, O Lord, I cannot ſtand in the Battel; I cannot, now the Arrows of Death ſtick in my Fleſh; and I cannot bear it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Concuſſions of Soul within me. But, O! O! O thou who art the God of all Grace, who art got upon the <hi>Kingdom of Grace,</hi> and art the Head of that Kingdom, wilt thou now <hi>ſhew thy Glory?</hi> Make Death ſweet, make the Tendencies to Death ſweet, make every ſtep to Deliverance a pleaſing ſtep, O my God. Save thy Worm, ſave thy Worm, O my God, according to thy Promiſes made to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> I hearken what the Lord will ſay; he will ſpeak Peace in the Blood of Jeſus. Suſtain me, O Lord; ſuſtain me: Thou art my <hi>Friend,</hi> as thou ſpakeſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> thou art my Friend. Doſt thou love me? Doſt thou at this time love me with thy whole heart, and with thy whole Soul? Doſt thou love me more than my neareſt and deareſt Friends? Than thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Relations here, that continue with me in my Tribulation? With a more inward intenſe Love? with an Infiniteneſs beyond all theſe? Lord, let me know that thou loveſt me in very Deed; let me know that thou knoweſt me by Name; let me know that thou haſt an eye upon me, more than Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Friends; let me know that every Act of thine towards me is the effect of thy Love. Love me, Oh now, with thy whole heart; Oh make me
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:109216:205"/> to believe it. Help me to apprehend that thou doſt take notice of me, and art with me every Moment; with me as to my preſent Caſe and Concernment. 'Tis dead Friendſhip when Friends cannot hear nor ſee one another; but ſure there is another Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between thee and thine, and thou ſtandeſt in Relations to them. Art not thou <hi>my Father?</hi> Hath not the Church ſaid ſo, Lord, thou art our Father? Thou art my <hi>Husband,</hi> my <hi>Brother,</hi> my <hi>Friend;</hi> and art not aſhamed to be called my Brother: Oh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful! Thou begatteſt me, I am born of thee. Lord, what ſhall I do with the great things of the Goſpel, if thou doſt not give forth the Spirit of Faith? O Lord, wilt thou who art Truth, who art Life, who art certain; wilt thou take the great work of my practical Religion upon thee? Thou canſt make it to be in Power and Truth unto me, as may anſwer the very deſign thou aimeſt at. I have been praying through the days of thy drawing me after thee. O Lord, I would come to that kind of praying, while I am here in the World, as might be a lovely Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of that praying, of that Converſe that will be with thee in Heaven. Will Prayer altogether ceaſe in Heaven? No ſurely. Lord, glorifie thy ſelf, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy ſelf; glorified be God. Oh, Oh that the very Life and Soul of that ſtate then may now be begun. Oh that I might haſten to that ſtate. Thou detaineſt me here in thy Wiſdom. I would go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and into that Life which will moſt glorifie thee eternally. I would go where Life is, and no Death. I would go where the fulleſt expreſſions of the power of Grace overcoming Sinners, may be patent and manifeſt in me; even in me, who am a poor Mortal. There be many things that I have found here that are Likeneſſes to pure Likeneſs to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:109216:206"/> thee; and here I have loſt wofully my way: Lord, open it. The heart is deceitful above all things, and it will have its working one way or other; but, Lord, I would go where there is Purity, I would go where there is <hi>Purity,</hi> without <hi>Impurity:</hi> I would be with thee, Lord; for then I can ſpeak to thee in thine own Language better.</p>
            <p>At about Two of the Clock that day in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, he further extended his Speech, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, The old World will be the <hi>old World</hi> ſtill, it will remain to <hi>Eternity;</hi> it will be only tranſlated from <hi>hence,</hi> where it received its Curſe, to <hi>Hell,</hi> to be in <hi>Chains of Darkneſs</hi> for ever: but all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed number ſhall be inſtated in their <hi>Palaces of Glory.</hi> I am in the very <hi>Period of Wonders:</hi> I am in the very Period of <hi>viewing Death</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> I am under ſome Sufferings, and they ſhall be ſweet. And (ſpeaking to himſelf) ſaid, Thou ſhalt lie down in thy Bed. And then ſpeaking to God, Thou wilt not throw me into the Grave in Anger: thou wilt put me into the Grave: Thou wilt not ſay, Sleep there in Death; thou wilt ſay, Sleep there a little, <hi>till the Indignation be over-paſt;</hi> till that is inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thee for Sin, which was pronounced; and that that paſſed away from Chriſt, ſhall paſs from me. Lord, thou wilt not be unfaithful to thy Word. God cannot lie; God cannot forget to be gracious: he cannot forget his own Work. This is that God I deſire to <hi>believe in,</hi> and reſolve eternally to <hi>cling upon,</hi> with the Truth of my whole heart. I have ſinned, and thou haſt <hi>pardoned</hi> me, and <hi>ſaved</hi> me with a high hand. Help me in this hour, take away my fears. The laſt ſtroak that will be given, will be by the Devil himſelf, becauſe it is his laſt Battel; and thou wilt permit him, but thou wilt bind him;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:109216:206"/> and when thou haſt unclinch'd his hands, he ſhall never clinch again. He is that laſt Enemy from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Lord, wilt thou, who haſt been deſtroying this Enmity all along, now cauſe his Enmity to appear to be deſtroyed, and turned into Powder and Rottenneſs. O, <hi>Have at it, have at it,</hi> I pray thee: The ſtrength, the might, the power of the Life of Sin and Darkneſs. Lord, thou didſt promiſe to plague Antichriſt for all the Plagues that he hath plagued thine; O Lord, do thou pour out thy Plagues upon him, whilſt thou doſt ſuſtain him to be fighting his laſt Battel. Let him fight his Battel; but let him, O God, <hi>drink of the Rivers of thy Wrath</hi> along with it. Let the Weak overcome the Strong; let thy People be Lyons, but let the Devil be an enfeebled Enemy. Serve thy ſelf of all thy Inſtruments, whatever they are; Lord, let them do thee the utmoſt Service of their Capacity. Thy <hi>proper Inſtruments,</hi> Oh make them glorious, make them glorious both in <hi>Qualification</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>improper Inſtruments,</hi> that are not Inſtruments of thy delight, cauſe them to do thy Will; for all that work that is proper for them, and proper to be uſed upon thy People, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thy Glory towards them: ſo that the Work of God may thrive in the World, and thy Glory be mightily exalted. O thy <hi>Majeſty,</hi> thy <hi>Kingdom,</hi> thy <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Excellency!</hi> Oh that thou wouldſt be wonderfully glorious in thy Actings: Thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo, and thy Actings do proceed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Excellency and Glory. Oh, let God be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; Oh, let God be glorified. And now thou haſt brought me and others forth at the Cloſe of the World; we lay aſleep in ſilence, we were not form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Womb till of late, and much of the great
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:109216:207"/> Volume of the World thou hadſt paſt away before we ſaw it; and now we come at the Cloſe, into the World a while; that we may <hi>ſtand in our Lots,</hi> and appear to be the <hi>Tokens</hi> of thy <hi>Remembrance</hi> of us, before the <hi>Volumes of many Generations.</hi> Now thou haſt me upon the Stage, and haſt had me long; and now thou ſeemeſt to be taking me hence. O Lord, thouſands of Kindneſſes I have had from thee, and thou haſt not had from me any ſuitable Thanks. O Lord, take me out of this Body; ſend me into the <hi>Land of Truth,</hi> where there is nothing but <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> Sometimes I begin a little to be amazed at my unſuitable Actings towards thee in the day of Grace: But, Lord, thou wouldſt carry things ſo, that I might know my Caſe, <hi>ſaved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> The beſt of all good things thou haſt given me, and thou haſt preſerved me whole; but alas, I muſt travel all the way with a dead Carcaſe, and be within the ſcent, the ſtench of it: Ah woful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour! And this hath made grievous Spoil. Thou ſaveſt me; and yet I carry that along with me that is my <hi>conſtant Deſtruction,</hi> as a <hi>continual Combatant,</hi> till I ſee thy Salvation. Thou <hi>loveſt me all over,</hi> and <hi>hateſt the leaſt Sin that is in me all over.</hi> And now, Lord, thou comeſt to ſhew me what the Iſſue of theſe things are. Little thou ſheweſt me; yet that little is glorious. Oh, for the Son of God to come into the World, to be joyned to me in the neareſt Conjunction; to aſſume the ſame Nature, and to unite me to himſelf; that he might diſplay the inſuperable Power of his own Righteouſneſs, for my Righteouſneſs, for my Juſtification. We have reaſon to think the Heavens will declare it, even this, to an Eternity; and this is paſt upon me. I can hardly endure a little at a <hi>Diſſolution:</hi> But O
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:109216:207"/> the power, the ſtrength, the greatneſs of this great Glory; things <hi>out of my ſight,</hi> and but a <hi>little before me.</hi> Oh, what are they, and where are they that have the whole Shine of the Grace of the Goſpel upon them? Where they are thou knoweſt, and every one of thy number ſhall know; they are not loſt, they are treaſured up. Lord help me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this little <hi>Period of Suffering.</hi> Here I am, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me to be juſt taking leave of this poor Body, that hath been wandring up and down ſome Years. Dear God, wilt thou be pleaſed to help me? Thou helpedſt me all along; now help me, that I may have ſuch thoughts as becomes an <hi>Heir of Life;</hi> that my <hi>Faith</hi> may not <hi>fail,</hi> that my <hi>Soul</hi> may not be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate,</hi> that my <hi>Mind</hi> may not be <hi>dark.</hi> Lord ſave me from the wonted Aſſaults of Satan, now I know not for how many days, or how many nights thou haſt deſigned me. Dear Lord, let me have thy ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Preſence</hi> with me, and a heart formed to thy <hi>Contrivance;</hi> and let me not contrive for my ſelf. I know not the effects of this night. If I ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod my days this night, let it be in <hi>Divine Reſt.</hi> I have no other <hi>Period</hi> but to be in <hi>God,</hi> to be in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There is no Iſſue of this Conflict, but to <hi>overcome by the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> Now I leave my ſelf with thee, be with me, and be with all thy dear <hi>Zion:</hi> Be with that beloved Spouze, whom thou haſt redeemed from the Earth; and this by means of the Contrivance of thy Grace in Chriſt; who lives, and will live, and is the <hi>beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God,</hi> and was ever ſo. There is a Promiſe of Truth; fulfil it, O true God: My People <hi>ſhall be all holy:</hi> verifie it, O God; verifie thine own Truth; thy Word hath ſaid it, My People ſhall be all holy. Lord, thou haſt a People, thou haſt ſure a
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:109216:208"/> People, and thy People thou haſt ſaid ſhall be known; or elſe there would be no diſcovery of thy Truth in Promiſes, of thy Truth in Threatnings: And, O Lord, this thou haſt ſaid; that there is the greateſt difference between thy People and their Concerns, and others, that ever was. Thou wilt be known in <hi>Jacob:</hi> Now, Lord, be thou pleaſed to make it known that we are thine; and let it be made known to all. We were tricked and beguiled away from thee at firſt, but now we are grafted into Life by that, that was not a <hi>Slight,</hi> but a <hi>Reallity;</hi> the <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Reality</hi> that ever <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> ſaw, that ever <hi>Angels</hi> ſaw: that is the thing I yearn towards. I reſt me in God here a little while; I am in the Spirit, waiting <hi>minutely, momently,</hi> when he will ſay, Come and retire to be with me <hi>eternally.</hi> Oh that I ſhould ſee the Door a little aſlope, a little ajar; he hath promiſed it no where as I know, but in a way of opening; yea, wide open, to give Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe his very heart is in it. With him are no half-opened Doors, nor half-hearted Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet a little while, and we ſhall ſay that Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is come, and the Compleatment of all. <hi>All Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and that will come on creeping apace: now, now it is coming to me. Oh, now let there be no <hi>blind</hi> Child of God; Oh, now no <hi>lazy</hi> Child of God; Oh, now for <hi>winged Saints;</hi> Oh, for thoſe that <hi>mount</hi> and <hi>ſoar,</hi> that may anſwer what hath been promiſed in the Book of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: The Spirit will have a time to do it, when <hi>Sloth</hi> ſhall be by the Spirit of Life turned into <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,</hi> when the Love of God ſhall be ſeven times more, when the Glory of Chriſt's Image ſhall be as when the Sun ſhineth ſeven times brighter. Will God always be ſcarcely known in the Earth? Will
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:109216:208"/> the God of all that Grace that ſhines in Men, be himſelf obſcured? No, no. How kind is he to poor Sinners in this dim ſtate? He longs to be glorified, and to glorifie himſelf; and his Children ſhall be like their high Calling. And, Oh, that this might make my Soul inſatiably longing for this Purity in its fulneſs: I adore him for any little Thirſt. O the good time, when the Heavens ſhall <hi>ſhrill</hi> with the Voices of all the <hi>Redeemed Hearts and Tongues.</hi> O the <hi>Melody,</hi> when every <hi>redeemed Tongue</hi> ſhall be able to ſpeak to the hearing of the ends of the whole Heavens. O the Melody of that great day, when <hi>Saints and Angels innumerable</hi> ſhall be the <hi>Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</hi> Oh, never ſuch Melody; Melody that may be heard <hi>Millions of Years, Millions of Miles.</hi> O Lord, keep me in my <hi>preſent</hi> work, till thou calleſt me to <hi>future</hi> work, and prepare me for the glorifying of thee for ever. Help me in this inſtant; help me, leave me not now; help me through this Thicket graciouſly. Lord, graciouſly deal with me at my Diſſolution, that nothing but Actings of Love and Grace may be ſhining upon Me. I leave me with thee; I deſire to do it perfectly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 19. He ſpake to one that had watched with him the foregoing Night; You ſee how it is with me. You are young; the Lord affect your heart with a true ſenſe of your eternal State, that you may not be befooled of your immortal Soul, by a tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Devil,</hi> and a tempting <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some ſpace after he took occaſion to ſay, It makes my Soul aſhamed within me ſometimes, that I have had the whole Book of all God's Promiſes and Covenant before me, and do believe that there is mine Inheritance; and yet to be in ſuch a poſture as I am. Alas, <hi>to be made the Children of the Moſt
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:109216:209"/> High, and to live like Fools;</hi> it ſhould make the Soul long to have the utmoſt of the Grace promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I expect every night, and every day, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry piece of a day to be gone; that when-ever any Qualm comes upon me, I am ready to think this is the time; and yet I find in my ſelf a natural Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy againſt Death, that I would, and I would not; but where-ever my Damp, my Black, my Diſquiet is, it ariſeth from ſome Tardineſs in my Soul to my God. I have a great deſire to be freed from my Burthens, and to be in that State I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long for; but yet I would willingly that God ſhould pitch my Stakes, and determine the matter. God's Wiſdom and his Goodneſs goes together; for God's Attributes do not croſs one another. I ought to have a <hi>Manly Walk</hi> with God: it is not a <hi>crouching, crimbling, childiſh, fooliſh, unexpert Walk.</hi> By Manly I mean, to weigh things as they are in the grave Diſcovery of Scripture. Surely I long to be in the Fountain, to ſee it, and be for ever in it.</p>
            <p>To one asking him how he did, he ſaid; It is a great Mercy that my Mind abides in any Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; and that the Wheels of the Clock do not fall all out of order. I cannot now converſe, but I think the Trade (meaning the Heavenly Trade) goes on; and the Lord make it a ſmart Trade. Lord, teach me how frail I am: all things are beſt known by Experience; as Learning is obtained by Obſervation, Rules, and Precepts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 20. Finding himſelf exceeding faint and weak, ſaid; I could now lie down and ſay, This is my laſt (if the Lord ſaw it fit;) having much ado to retain Life.</p>
            <p>To a Chriſtian Friend that came to viſit him, he ſaid; Bleſſed be the Lord for the Covenant of Grace,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:109216:209"/> and the Surety of that Covenant, where our ſtay is; All Goodneſs, all Mercy, all Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The way and method God takes, he himſelf hath cut out, but what his ſcope is in this my preſent Caſe, I do not know.</p>
            <p>Afterward it being told him of the death of an aged Relation, who lived to above fourſcore Years, he ſpake to this effect; Is he dead, with whom I never had the opportunity, ſeriouſly to converſe with in the things of a ſpiritual World? Surely this is the time to do any thing for God, and to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others. The Lord bleſs the Providence to that poor Woman, his Wife.</p>
            <p>To another Friend taking leave, and ſaying, The Lord be with you, I hope he will carry you to your Journeys end; he replied, I hope he will: I believe he will never leave me, nor forſake me.</p>
            <p>To another poor Chriſtian he gave this Counſel; Cling upon Chriſt, and he will never leave you. I cannot ſay much, but be ſure of that; follow hard after Chriſt, and he will never leave you: That is all my Experience, all that I have been a learning of the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God theſe ſcores of Years. Only love him, only obey him, entirely ſeek him, pray to him much; for that is the only likelieſt way: and I never heard of any that did it faithfully, and was loſt.</p>
            <p>Then he prayed; O my God, be near me; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing to miſcarry, through the All-ſufficiency of thy infinitely great Grace.</p>
            <p>To a dear Friend that came to viſit him; telling him, that he was very much upon the hearts of the People of God, who prayed for him; he replied theſe words, That one heart of Chriſt ſets other hearts awork. He farther ſaid, I am glad to ſee you,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:109216:210"/> upon account of former Intimacy; but I chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that you have found the ſame God in Prayer that I have done, and that you are hankering after the ſame Fountain and Spring, and cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; as God hath given me alſo an unwearied Reach after: and upon theſe Grounds I am glad to ſee you. My dear Friend, fare you well: the Lord be with you.</p>
            <p>To a Relation he ſpake thus; Spring to Heaven, though for your ſpringing, you ſpring out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and leave it behind you. Let us look to it, leſt you and I fall ſhort of our Hope: Multitudes of Profeſſors ſtanding aloof off, have loſt their way; they have loſt their work, they have loſt their end. Our opportunity is as clear in our hand now, as ever it was in the hand of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of the Saints of God that lived before us. Oh, how do I love to ſee Grace grow in Friends, in Relations! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord be with you, and carry you, and make your Affliction to be a ſanctified Affliction; that in a little while you may not have any burthen, but may ſee your Salvation, and have it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 21. To another Viſitant he ſpake thus; I may not ſtand wondering (meaning in reference to his long Sickneſs) but yet I may wonder indeed, that ever God made me a Man, that ever he made me a rational Creature, that ever he brought me forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, where the Goſpel was; and that he hath told me, that he will ſave me for ever: Oh, that I could wonder, admire, and adore it. You duggle up and down, and ſo I have done heretofore: and here we walk over but a little Ground; and if we obtain little or much, it is but a little got in a little Ground, and we have therein trouble. But, Oh, what is it to flee over the whole Heavens, and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:109216:210"/> to be every where in God, and in Chriſt? In all other good things relating only to this Life, all the pleaſure we have in ſeeking them is, to think how pleaſurable they will be to us, when obtained. But the delight and pleaſure of ſpiritual things lie much in the very ſeeking of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 22. Being the Lord's Day in the Afternoon, to a Friend that came to ſee him, he expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus: The Doctor hath told me the lightſomeſt News to day, that he hath told me a great while, in acquainting me that there is but little hope of my Continuance long in the World; but the Afflictions of God's People lie near my heart. Oh, to be filled with the Spirit three or four hours in Prayer for the <hi>Concerns of</hi> Sion.</p>
            <p>He farther ſpake in his particular Caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus; What if they that have ſeen me ſhall ſee me no more, if he ſees me, that hath ſeen my Yearnings and Groanings; if he ſees me again, he will not ſay, he knows me not: he is a God that will not forget his Promiſe. He who hath ſeen my Soul in Travel, who hath ſeen thoſe Pangs of deſire that no other hath ſeen; he will be ready to ſay in the Riches of his Grace, Here is poor ſuch a one come to my Gate: Come to my Knee, Come to my Mercy-Seat. Oh, for affectionate thoughts of God, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into him; they are things that will not dry up, they will not wither, that will not be parched up. Oh, bleſſed be that heart that is thorow in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Oh, where is that glorious Majeſty? Oh, what is it to come to the firſt Spring of Spiritual Life? To come to God, to the God that hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me into my threeſcore and tenth Year, with a high hand? And now he fore-ſeeing, the remainder of my days would be Sorrow and Labour to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:109216:211"/> he calls me off: And what is threeſcore and ten Years, compared with Eternity? A poor Pittance of time, wherein God hath had very little Service from me. Thus I parle a little about it, to get ſome deep thoughts of that unſpeakable Majeſtick Grace. Little can I ſay of my Religion more than this; I love the Lord in all he did, I love him in all his Image. I may ſay, <hi>I may lay me down and reſt, for the Lord ſuſtaineth me;</hi> I have no other, I deſire no other.</p>
            <p>Lord, glorifie thy Name; I have had caring thoughts about my ſelf and others, but now thou ſeemeſt to determine the matter. Thou didſt ſee I could not ſtand in the Shock, but in thy ſtrength I could have ſtood: But thou wilt not cauſe all thy Waves, and thy Billows to paſs over me. Thou haſt had thy Champions, and wilt have thy Champions. Lord, the Clouds ariſe apace, the Wicked are full of Wrath; they would root out thy Intereſt, they would make <hi>Jacob</hi> low, they are ſet upon Miſchief and Spight. Ariſe, ariſe, O God; let the Lamb deliver, let the Lamb overcome, let thy unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enemies be turned over to Judgment. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the place of thy Holineſs, confirm the Weak, fix the Staggering. Let thy People be able to meet Sufferings, to put on Faith and Patience; and ſay, Aha, Aha; We are for God, and his Ways. Let thy People meet Death, meet Loſſes, meet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Enemy can do; and ſay, We ſcorn your Cruelty. Oh that thy People may ſtick by thee, when there is nothing but Violence, and Contradiction of thy Will. O Lord, work wonders for thy People; break the Arm, cut aſunder the Bow of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. Oh, let Shame be upon thoſe that would take away thy Worſhip. Glorifie thy ſelf; appear,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:109216:211"/> and ſtand an invincible Champion in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Let the earth know that thou doſt poſſeſs the Gates of thine Enemies. Let my Soul come into the Bundle of Life; let my Soul come to all that, that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I am to receive the Salvation of my Soul with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Joy.</p>
            <p>Am I near to the great Revelation of Chriſt, to know more than ever <hi>Solomon</hi> did with that Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Nature he had, and Attainment of Grace? Am I near to attain more than ever <hi>Paul</hi> could reach to, by the Power of Grace; and to know more of the Covenant of Grace than <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf did, and all the Saints, while they were here in the World? Oh, I am confounded, I am confounded and aſtoniſhed; I wonder, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at Free Grace; and am amazed for want of more Faith. The Filthy, the Filthy duggle, of a reſpect to my own Works, which would follow me, and ſpoil me, and ſpoil all the Myſtery of Free Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh that now at laſt, the Glory of Free Grace might lift me into the eternal place of it.</p>
            <p>To a near Relation he ſpake thus; Brother, you are come to take your leave of me: The Doctor, as a ſweet Meſſenger, told me to day, that I am near my Change. I am now going from <hi>Shadows,</hi> to <hi>Subſtance;</hi> from things <hi>imperfect,</hi> to things <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat;</hi> and the thoughts of it even confound me. I have been trading in the things of God for almoſt threeſcore years, as to the experience of it; and now, after this long WOOF upon the LOOM, it is to be taken off, and all of it VIEWED; and I know a World of Evil there is: but I have always had a Sufficiency of the Grace of the Goſpel declared to me, that as defects came in, they might be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:109216:212"/> and by his Grace I have kept on with ſome deſire, with ſome delight, with ſome Faith and Chear; and now the RECKONING is to be made. O my God, <hi>there is a great Tranſaction upon me: I throw my ſelf upon Chriſt in the Goſpel: I ſink if Chriſt ſinks:</hi> I have had nothing elſe to reſt the Sole of my Foot upon; now let thy Mercy be for me. Thou haſt given me good hope through Grace; now Lord, anſwer every good word, upon which thou haſt cauſed my Soul to hope. Thou haſt brought me hitherto, ſo far, to the very end of the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> now, O God, bring me to thy <hi>Canaan:</hi> I have waited for it. Many other Sickneſſes have not removed me; now thou ſeemeſt to ſay, <hi>This ſhall.</hi> Now let me leave all my Filth behind me; take it off. There is a TRANSLATION; <hi>let that Tranſlation be effected upon me.</hi> O Lord, let not that Temptation come upon me, that I have prayed to no purpoſe, that I have faltered in the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou haſt ſteered my Soul in Truth, and in Spirit. Lord, let not a dead thought abide with any ugly ſavour in me, now, when thy Providences, with the Concurrence of thy Servants (meaning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors) ſay that thou calleſt me; when they ſay, <hi>The Maſter calleth thee.</hi> Oh, Oh, was there ever ſuch a day? Had I ever ſuch a day to be ſtanding in the Portal, to be waving up my hand, to be knocking? Oh, for an Opening. Lord, ſay to me, <hi>I will open; Come in, and let us ſup together:</hi> No leſs, O Lord. Anſwer the Breathings of my Soul all along, all my days. Thou art faithful, thou haſt choſen me; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me not. O thou that art Truth, thou knoweſt that I have choſen thee. Thou knoweſt, <hi>my Life in this World hath been Death and Poyſon to me without thee:</hi> and now I come, only expecting what thou
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:109216:212"/> haſt promiſed, and not what I have procured; for there hath been my BATTEL all my days; not to look for any thing of my own procuring, but to throw my ſelf on thy <hi>procuring Grace:</hi> there hath been the WAR. I ſaid, if there be not the Son of God to ſave me, all my Works are vain; there is no bottom in what I have done: It is alone what thou doſt, in thy Council and Purpoſe of Grace. There I have deſired to lie, and to comfort my ſelf in, and have had comfort therein. And upon that ſcore thou haſt made me aſhamed of the unſuitable Actings of mine; thou haſt made me aſhamed of them. Now I would flee over theſe my great Sins, upon the <hi>Wings of Faith:</hi> and now, Lord, let me have Light and Truth. Thou knoweſt I appeal to thee thy ſelf, O God; thou knoweſt, things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to thy Doctrine, and the Grace contained in it, have been my burthen. Thou knoweſt I have not had Quiet, but in Reliance on thine own <hi>Free Grace:</hi> and this thou haſt done. Thou layedſt not in this Principle for no uſe, but to aſſure the Soul, thou wilt not miſ-lead it. O Lord, ſave the preſent contending part of thy Church in the World. This hath been the BATTEL all along: Man loſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite. Thou haſt brought in a Salvation, and didſt give it, and thy People have received it; and thy People never had Comfort, but as this Grace did ſhine forth. Thy Children have been killed and ſlain for this very thing. And now, O Lord, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Oh maintain the great Quarrel. What, doth all thy Peoples Salvation depend on this; and ſhall the Enemy deſpoil them of it? No, no. I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee, and let me go upon the <hi>Wing of thy abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Grace;</hi> and ſo let all that have found this Grace, and have given Credit to it. I have a World of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:109216:213"/> Evil to ſay of my ſelf, for I have nothing elſe; but that, that I lean upon is <hi>the Truth, the Vertue, the Grace and Faithfulneſs of my God.</hi> Lord help me in this great thing, and all thy People in this particular; that they may be comforted in it, and rejoyce in the hopes of it. There is none of us yet that hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through Death (divers Chriſtian Friends being then preſent) many of us have been brought near to it, but have not actually paſſed it. And now ſeeing ſome of us are dropping into it; Lord, let not theſe great things be ſtrange to us, nor be little to us, as to the ſettling of our ALL: Oh, had we made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Markets of it, better Improvements, we might have been at a mighty <hi>Brightneſs in Holineſs.</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thy Name, we have been kept doing, but we have had many Put-bies, we have not walked like Perſons of ſo high a Calling; but thou pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in ſuch a way, that the whole Heaven will ring of thy pardoning Goodneſs. Help us to jog on, help us to jog on, that every one of us may come up, and fulfil our Task; that when we leave the World, we may look upon it as a <hi>Memento</hi> of that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing of a GOD, that makes his own Choice between one Soul and another.</p>
            <p>He further prayed thus; Help me till I come, help me a while, O Lord: I know I am in the Fleſh, and have the things relating to the Fleſh; But, O Lord, till thou removeſt me hence, be teaching me ſtill, care for me ſtill; let all things preceding ſo great a Change be wrought in me; and let thy Care, Bleſſing, Love, and Grace be upon my dear Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, Kindred, and Friends I leave behind: Lord, keep them, purge them, make them ſhine more and more; make the Generation now and hereafter more holy.</p>
            <pb n="393" facs="tcp:109216:213"/>
            <p>Let the Vengeance of the Wicked return upon their own heads; let none of thine faint in the day of Battel; give in Strength, Faith ſuperabundant to the Troubles thy People meet with. Give Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Joy and Valour, which the Enemy cannot vanquiſh; and rid the World of theſe Impurities. O Lord, make haſte and deſtroy Autichriſt. O Lord, meet with the Proud; Oh, cut their Hoofs, make them aſhamed with perpetual Confuſion, and undo their Projects; make them ſtink all the Earth over.</p>
            <p>I leave theſe things with thee. I have peruſed thy Word through thy Mercy: if in any thing I ſtep aſide, pardon it; for thou haſt infinite Meaſures of Pardon with thee. O God, be with me for ever, and <hi>receive my Spirit,</hi> whenever thou takeſt me out of the World.</p>
            <p>Then he directed his Speech to an aged Perſon preſent thus: You have lived in Profeſſion long, as I have done; ſet your ſelf before God with ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if you had never yet put any Foot in his Paths; beg of him Truth in the inward parts; beg his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and with full ſubjection to him, account a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> in it ſelf only conſidered, a pitiful thing; and that, that is to be feared, hath been the occaſion of the Ruin of many a Soul. See to it, that you be a real <hi>Member of Chriſt.</hi> I do not know but that I have as much reaſon to queſtion mine own Soul, and it may be more, than to queſtion yours. But hearken a little, for now I come to the upſhot; there is no dallying, my God hath a piercing eye; the Truths I have heard, they are from God. The ſame Care, Fear, Cautiouſneſs I would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning others, as of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Then he ſpake to all in general. Oh that after ſo

               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:109216:215"/> much of the Spirit of God appearing, we might not be poor, ſimple, unlearned things; for here we have had a little, and ſeen a little of the Temptations of the Devil, and a great deal too much. What is the end of our Church-Communion, but that we may be brought into the Fellowſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in-deed, in-deed? And then he hath taken care for the Outward, and the Inward Man; to make the Soul ſteady, ingenious and diligent; and to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy always to honour him, to give him Honour, and to defend his Honour. And thus I hope the Lord will go along with us alſo: Oh, Oh, Oh, let there be none of the ugly ſtench of a barren Religion. Oh, Oh, Oh that the Holy Spirit may be doing in every one of our hearts, that ſuch a little pittance of time may not be loſt. We are even at the Judgment-Seat, every one of us; here is a Judgment-Seat. Each of us have often Sickneſſes, and I perceive my concluding Sickneſs is come, and to the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt I muſt go: Oh, for my ADVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATE; <hi>he will not hide himſelf.</hi> We talk of the World to come, and mind not the nature of it; the Lord open our eyes: I would be at it, I would be at it.</p>
            <p>My dear Friends, it is a pleaſant ſight to ſee one another; but ſuppoſe, before a general known Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt, we might have a Months time, and that to be together; one would think with what exceeding ſeriouſneſs we ſhould improve that time. And truly now is much alike in the length of time here; It is but a ſhort thing when we have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. God hath ſaid ſuch a thing, and it is true thouſands of years after. The Lord ſave us from the Pollution of the Times: Oh that we may not diſcover our Nakedneſs in ſuch a day as this. The Lord hath called his People Soldiers. The Battel is,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:109216:215"/> when there is no way to eſcape; then is the very time to enter the Shock with our ſpiritual Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and then is the day to honour God above all things, if we ſhould be tempted to any thing ſinful, to any thing wherein God is diſpleaſed, and the Souls Communion with him wounded. O venturous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts purely for God, are huge Increaſers of Grace; and to be cheary in it, and not as Perſons undone: but there muſt be Faith, Patience, Hope, Belief of the Scriptures, intimate Communion with God, that carries it thus out. If I believe that God is infinite; and is he infinite? Then he can do any thing for me, and will do it. If I believe he is good, he will do good to me; for he hath ſaid, he will do it <hi>with his whole heart,</hi> and <hi>with his whole Soul.</hi> The Lord make you more fruitful Plants in his Houſe, bearing Fruit. Oh, Oh, that you and I, while in this World, may not think too ſlightly of our high Calling. Oh, Strength doth fail me to ſpeak of it; but ſurely it will be the great ſhame, if any ſenſible ſhame can be hereafter; or at leaſt, there will be ſomething of an Equivolence to it; that ever we ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a holy Calling to Eternal Life, and yet that there ſhould be no greater difference between us and the Uncalled of the World. The difference is as much as if a Man ſhould be ſent to ranſom one out of Slavery, and another left in perpetual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; but this Slavery of Hell, to be redeemed from it, is unconceivable and unutterable; and yet to walk ſo like others in any thing. O, O, ſhould the nobleſt Creatures on Earth walk up and down in the World like a Toad, and the higheſt Rank of Men, that have Parts and Abilities, walk up and down like pitiful Creatures, that ſcarce know how to walk in a poſture as Men. Oh, for a trim,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:109216:216"/> neat, watchful, prudent Chriſtian. Every Dram of Purity, Neatneſs, Fruitfulneſs ſprings from God; and therefore, when the Soul anſwers its <hi>High Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> it takes no leſs than God; it takes, it receives him. It is not to gaze upon him in a way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only, but to get in him who is the Fountain of Holineſs; and this is the Communion of Saints. Communion with God, there is the bottom of all Communion; and having that, then we grow up in God, <hi>into him in all things, who is the Head.</hi> There is an ugly thing ever coming in, as if we may have all the Privileges of the Goſpel, and yet <hi>walk at a Looſe,</hi> as an <hi>unbended Bow:</hi> and from this thing, doubtleſs, many with abundance of hopes have tipt over, and never ſaw the <hi>Land of Jordan;</hi> and ſo have died and periſhed. We may gueſs with our ſelves there is ſomething in it, when the Spirit of God ſaith to us, <hi>watch, watch,</hi> and that we ſhould <hi>exhort one another,</hi> and bids us often to <hi>beware,</hi> which is given us as a Cauſionary Word: and indeed, whilſt I am in the World, let it ſtick with me; and whilſt you are in the World, let it ſtick with you. We have gone on in a formal way, and there hath been a ſtrange kind of Benummedneſs upon the Souls of Chriſtians. What is a Church for, but <hi>for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of Ordinances more inwardly and ſpiritually, as a Church of Chriſt.</hi> We have had mighty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of theſe things, and have them ſtill, bleſſed be God; but I would have my Soul, while I am in the World, and every other Soul alſo, greatly to be a queſtioning whether or no my naked YEA AND NAY doth come up to the Holineſs of Chriſt or no, for we ſhould be like him; he doth not ſay a little like him, but <hi>like him;</hi> and the Soul ſhould aim at that; which to be without, is a ſign that the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:109216:216"/> heart is rotten, or invaded with Rottenneſs to a great Declenſion. As he that is an Apprentice to a rich Man, he aims to come up to his Maſter's Eſtate, there is ſuch a thing in the nature of the deſire of ſuch a one: and if it were ſo in our <hi>Spiritual Trade,</hi> Chriſtians Converſe would be more with reſpect to their glorious Country; and that would keep Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſo warm between them, that if there were any thing unbecoming in any, they would not ſpare to ſpeak of it to them, that ſo the heart of a dear Friend may be delivered from the Guilt of Sin, and be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the way of Life.</p>

               <hi>April</hi> 23. He ſpake as followeth. No Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here makes me to think of what ſpoken in the <hi>Revelation; He ſhall lead them to the living Springs, Rev.</hi> 7. 17. He will open Rivers in the Tops of the Mountains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30 25. and 41. 18. near at hand; but not yet actually poſſeſſed, near at hand; but a little temporary Life ſtands in the way. Oh, to the Hungry every bitter thing is ſweet. I am this day ſuffering the puniſhment of the pleaſure that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> took in eating the forbidden Fruit. I am this day ſuffering under that, and might have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it eternally, in all the horrour and fury of it, but that a Saviour hath appeared with <hi>an everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the midſt of Heaven,</hi> on whom he bids me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and on him I relie. Whereupon a <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, ſaid to him, The <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> is a better Head than the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was. To which he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Oh, Bleſſed be Divine Grace, there is a great difference indeed; for always Chriſt and his Grace is rendred with <hi>a much more;</hi> and it is from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. All that are taken into that <hi>dear Chriſt,</hi> they are as clearly <hi>ſtated in Life,</hi> as by the <hi>firſt Adam in Death;</hi> theſe are the words of a God that cannot
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:109216:217"/> lie. Here is ground of Faith, grond of Confidence; where the Soul hath fled for Refuge, and made it his buſineſs to flee thither, and no where elſe. There is a Paſſage, and it is an incumbring Paſſage, and all muſt paſs it; and that Paſſage I am in; there is no expectation of Life to revert back; and a longing deſire I have to paſs through it; and here I am wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that <hi>delivering word,</hi> and <hi>to ſee the Glory of God.</hi> I cannot deliver my ſelf from mine own Spittle. Thus I wear off, and ſhall be ſeen here no more.</p>
            <p>To another Viſitant, he ſaid, You ſee me at a <hi>parting view;</hi> the Lord be good to you and your Husband. And ſhe anſwered; Oh that my parting (meaning, out of this Life) might be with the <hi>like Comfort,</hi> and with the <hi>like preſence of God.</hi> And he again ſpake, ſaying; The Lord make your Religion thorow-pace, and your Labours in that Family ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; and enable you to overcome, when Powers without, and Temptations within aſſault you.</p>
            <p>To another at his taking leave, ſaying, The Lord be with you; he ſaid, I hope the Lord is with me; and I have Ground of Faith and Hope, that I have favour in his Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 24. He expreſſed himſelf as followeth; I am upon the Term of two great things, <hi>viz.</hi> At the Term of all my great <hi>Subjugation to Sin,</hi> and at the Term of all the <hi>Receipt of the Liberty Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed;</hi> at the Term of <hi>Sins Thraldom,</hi> and at the Term of <hi>ſpringing up through the Grace of God to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> Theſe are great things, and I cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage my thoughts about it thorowly, through the greatneſs of it. I am going from the <hi>Yellings of Sin in this World, and the woful effects of it;</hi> and I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Congregation, the only Church of the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:109216:217"/> written in Heaven; to viſit the Streets of the eternal Grace and Love of God, and meet the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that walk there.</hi> And methinks I am in a Wood, and God hath held me in the Portal a pretty while, and here I cannot be perfected; for I never had any fittedneſs, but through him that is compleat, and is in Heaven. And here I abide an Expectant, as the poor Man that expected to be put into the Pool; and that Angel hath not yet put forth his hand. My Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy parcheth, my Mind parcheth; <hi>a little Faith and Hope is left me.</hi> My Tongue begins again to cleave; I leave this World as a place where there is no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying: It may content others a while, but it ſeems rather to hunt me away. <hi>Body faint, Spirit faint, in a ſtrange Land, my Mind is all in a ſcatter:</hi> It will not be ſo; it is ſo now. O Lord, help me gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to wait. Death was always ſpoken of as a dark Valley, a place of Darkneſs and Trial; not a place of Joy; and ſhall I find it ſo? Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have hope in the Faith and Love of God by Chriſt; there is a ſecret Relief, <hi>That he will turn Death into Life for his own ſake, and ſuffer never a clinging Soul to be lopt off and periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire no Food, my very Nature loaths it; my Body is off from all means of help in this World, and here I ſtay, through the good hand of God, like a poor Stranger. I am going to another World, and the Fruits of that World will not ſatisfie the Wants I have here; it will not quench my Thirſt, it will not allay my Drought: So that if I have not ſome Relief to my Soul which is not of this World, if I have it not from another World, I am undone. I cannot ſpeak, my thoughts have a large Theam; I am up and down, in and out, and I ſee a great thing before me, and ſometimes it cauſeth a Word
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:109216:218"/> to drop. I ſee ETERNAL LIFE before me: That great thing that concerns me. Sure it is a great thing to be at the very Brink: to ſee all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes fulfilled, made good; and all the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel made patent: To ſee the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Eternal Life for ever laid, and to come and caſt ones eye upon it in the abundance of Faith. And theſe are the things that lie juſt before me; only there hath been an entrance about them; <hi>I have believed,</hi> &amp;c. and now I go to ſee the Promiſe, and the Faith of the Promiſe accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>To a Friend ſaying, you have a ſtrong hand to carry you. Sure, there is our Security in his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, more than in our holding of him. He anſwered; There it only lies. The Lord continue to be with you. The Lord make good his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to you, I, and all the reſt; even that which is written in that good Book of his, in which we deſire to have our hope. <hi>Let nothing hinder our Faith, nor diſorder our Practiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He proceeded further to ſpeak that day in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, thus; God makes all theſe things here, with reſpect to me at this time, as it were to change their kind. A Draught of Spring-Water, freſh Beer, or ſuch a like thing; how ſweet have I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found it! But now, nothing. The rare vertues of Apples, and other Fruits; they are to me now as Dirt, they do not anſwer my End. My natural Thirſt and Deſire cannot be gratified with any thing here. Though my Body lies parching away with Thirſt, my Soul loatheth dainty Meats; and the beſt of Liquors that have been pleaſing, they are now a burthen to me: I can taſte nothing that will give reviving. <hi>God is drawing forth my Nature in the way of a Diſſolution; that I muſt have no more Chear
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:109216:218"/> now, but what comes in by New Covenant Mercy; and that will be to Soul, to Body for ever:</hi> and thanks be to his Name, he will not have me feed with dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Company. He hath ſhewed me the way of Life: he hath cauſed me to chuſe him, I bleſs his Name. Oh that wonderful thing, that thou ſhouldſt cauſe me to chuſe thee. Oh that thou mighteſt be choſen by all thoſe that ever I had Acquaintance with in all my Life. Oh that none of them may go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Oh, for a turned heart. Oh, for the eyes of Light and Life. Oh, for Salvation out of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to a changed People. Bleſſed be God that ANY, that ſo MANY near to me were turned in at the <hi>right Gate of Election,</hi> upon the Downfall that came by Sin, as I hope, as I hope. O Lord, find out thine; thou wilt find them out. Work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, work Miracles by converting Power, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls, that the Earth may ſee thy Glory. Oh, thou haſt been my God; many ways haſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it. Thou haſt been the God of the Family from whence thou chuſeſt me. The Family is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at an end. Thou haſt not left our poor Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; two of us are yet remaining on the Earth. O my God, let it be for an eternal Renown to thy Name, that thou haſt hitherto reached out thy Grace to we two poor Remainers of that numerous Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Oh, thou haſt left us thy ſelf to be our God, to be our Portion. O Lord, thou haſt given thy ſelf to us, and and thou haſt given thy Spirit into us; and we, to the Glory of thy Grace, can ſay, Thou art OUR GOD, haſt been our God, and wilt be our God; and wilt number us amongſt thoſe whom thou haſt delighted to take pleaſure in unto Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. O Lord, be thou the God of our Seed, or of our Seeds Seed: O Lord, that thou wouldſt take
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:109216:219"/> them in with all thoſe thou haſt brought into Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thy ſelf. We have Relations in the World; ſome that lie under the power of Satan, and thou makeſt us to know it, that it might be a <hi>conſtant Grief unto our hearts.</hi> O Lord, that none relating to us, or to any or either of us might be found in thoſe Bonds. O Lord, that thou wouldſt imprint thine Image; that thou wouldſt come with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand, and clear them out of <hi>Satan</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom,</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> Lord, we are mingled in the World; we have many Relations now up and down: and what ſhall we ſay for the <hi>Children of our People?</hi> O Lord, wilt thou look down? O let not our Seed, our Kindred, our Relations be a means to fill the Kingdom of Satan further and further. We look upon ſome of our Relations ſometimes, and there we cannot ſee the Likeneſs of Chriſt, the powerful working of their turning unto God; we cannot ſee any thing to give us any aſſurance, or to give us good hope through Grace, that there is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Eternity abiding them. Oh that thou wouldſt leſſen the Devil's Kingdom, and enlarge Chriſt's Kingdom. Why ſhould not the Word in the power of it be received? O Lord, fall in privately in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, upon the hearts of ſuch poor Creatures whom we love, but cannot ſave; but thou canſt: And thou art our God, and we love thee, and we beg it of thee, that thou mayſt have a <hi>mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed Hoſt, to ſing thy praiſe for ever;</hi> and that our Relations may be part thereof conſiderably. We have prayed little for one another in the Spirit; for we have done but little work for thee: <hi>Oh that an Afternoon Prayer may come up before thee, and be heard.</hi> Oh! oh! oh while we can, let our hearts bleed over ſinners that live in their ſins! Chriſt had nothing to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:109216:219"/> do but to ſave Souls in all his Travelling in the World. Oh that Salvation may be unto us the great deſirable thing; <hi>the ſalvation of our own Souls, and the Salvation of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a great thing to be going juſt into <hi>eternal Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and to be going juſt into <hi>eternal Freedom.</hi> It is a great thing to be going juſt into the <hi>eternal Pound,</hi> and to be going juſt into <hi>eternal Liberation;</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us is going, and ſhall go, and cannot avoid it, into one of theſe. We muſt in among the <hi>damned for ever;</hi> or in among the <hi>ſaved for ever;</hi> there is no medium, no manner of medium, between one and the other. Oh for Wiſdom, Oh for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we talk freely one to another; we are Friends; we have delight one in another; we viſit one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in our well-being, in our ill-being; we ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize one with another: but all of us, one as well as another, muſt paſs through this great Trial, and theſe great things; there will be no ſtop, no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance. We have and do approve of one another with ſome reſpect; but Oh <hi>nothing but Truth in the inward parts, nothing but coming up to the very mind of the Spirit of God</hi>—.</p>
            <p>Let the Grace of Chriſt now be purſued hugely, infinitely; <hi>lets know one another, but in the Lord; love one another, regard one another, reſpect one another only in the Lord, and through him, and for him, and to him.</hi> O Lord, the faculties of Humane Nature will not be diſabled when the perfect ſtate comes, which are now diſabled by ſin, and diſabled by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>
            <p>Thus now you ſee, my Soul having objects before mine Eye of a great nature, and finding my ſelf greatly incompetent for them; I grope about them, for I know it is my dear and only concern. <hi>I would
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:109216:220"/> not dye like a fool;</hi> and I would have all my loving Friends partake of that goodneſs which I have had perſwaſion, and have perſwaſion, doth lye in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere cloſure with thoſe Spiritual things. I do inſiſt on it, and ſay my full Faith is in this, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth reject this Salvation ſhall have no place in it; and whoſoever doth not with a whole heart ſet out for it, ſhall not know it; and whoſoever ſhall indeed give a turn over to the Lord for it, and commit it ſelf unto God to be tryed, to be taught, and to be lead, ſuch a Soul ſhall not at all loſe the good of it, nor any part of the good of it; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this confidence, <hi>I deſire to ſet me to cling to him who hath called me ſome years ago; and in ſome meaſure by his Grace, I have heard the Call and accepted it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then directed his Speech to ſome of his near Relations then preſent; more particularly <hi>by way of Counſel,</hi> &amp;c. in ſuch words as theſe:</p>
            <p>Dear Siſter, Remember me to your Son, and pray tell him from me, that I long for his Salvation, and (let it not be unpleaſing news to him) that the SCRIPTURE <hi>muſt be his Rule and Delight, otherwiſe he will periſh eternally.</hi> Every thought I have of him doth come with a great weight upon me; and my very Bowels do even bleed towards him; and it would be glorious News to me, to hear that the Almighty had got a <hi>compleat victory over his Heart.</hi> O Lord come in upon his Soul, that there may be no <hi>diſmal periſhing.</hi> Ah, ah, we have had our days of Friendlineſs together: Lord grant that none of us may be ſeparated each from other with a <hi>doleful ſeparation.</hi> Oh! Oh! that Divine Grace may come with power, and do that which our hearts could not be aware of. He is the <hi>object of our pity;</hi> oh that he may be the <hi>object of God's pity;</hi>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:109216:220"/> he is able to bound him; he can give a broken Leg, ſome ſtroak upon the outward Man, ſome ſickneſs, ſome providence that may have a <hi>Mighty Teaching voice.</hi> I have often thought, God may cauſe his Converſion work to ring to the Glory of God. Oh that you and others may pray greatly. And that, that poor young Woman may not be as a nullity neither, but as one filled with the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that Grace may revive in that Family: Oh Grace! Grace! Grace! nothing maules down <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>vileneſs,</hi> but the <hi>Majeſty of Grace.</hi> Dear Siſter, now do you ſet on work; we are yet upon <hi>pardoning ground.</hi> Pray much, Give away your ſelf to God in <hi>length and breadth.</hi> The Lord make you the <hi>brokenedſt hearted one,</hi> and the <hi>wiſeſt woman</hi> about this Town. Rummidge over your Religion again, and ſee whether it come up kindly to the <hi>MARK.</hi> I may ſay my Soul doth dearly love you; and whenever I ſee you, my heart doth in ſome degree ſpring a little. For my poor ſake, look out for a TRUE LODGING. Well, I leave it with you, I ſhall ſee you ſhortly again at the <hi>Judgment-ſeat of God.</hi> I leave this with him; my purpoſes, my deſigns, my aymes with him, who is holy and ſin pardoning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Counſel to his Wife</hi> was in theſe words; God hath given you his precious Grace, walk humbly; labour in all things to come to the very life of it in Religion. And I have much perſwaſion, that God will bring this Child (meaning his only Daughter) in within the Covenant. Your great danger is your <hi>unbelief,</hi> there lyes your great danger; you have, in my obſervation, <hi>true Faith, ſtrong Faith,</hi> and yet not ready to put forth in all Caſes; 'tis of a right Grain, and it hath the concomitant to it, <hi>ſingleneſs of heart.</hi>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:109216:221"/> Be <hi>Practical,</hi> be <hi>Practical,</hi> that you be putting of it out every minute; for I do think there is a very dear indulgence between Chriſt and your Soul, you have been born down with many cares, with many ſcatterings of heart, and Chriſt hath pittied you under it, and owned you under it. He hath kept up a rare thirſt (through his goodneſs) after him, and a delight in the ways of his communications. But I would not, it is not for me, to ſpeak theſe things; <hi>you ſhould be vain in your own conceit:</hi> But go on, I ſee the Foundation laid; he will never leave you; be at reſt. And now ſtudy the great myſtery of the Goſpel, of which you have a large notion; but I would have you turn every <hi>notion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>practical work,</hi> a <hi>practical acting,</hi> into a <hi>practical uſe.</hi> I would have you turn it all: and labour to do it every day, that <hi>what you believe</hi> may be ſo to you, as <hi>ſubſtance and not Air;</hi> and the Lord will viſit you and help you: Your Nature is timorous and fearful, but God coming in to fill your Soul with Faith, and fill Faith with powerful workings; you will have a great Friend at every turn to be for you, to be with you; for you will be able to truſt God, when you ſee not why nor wherefore to truſt to his promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Speech and Charge to his only Child,</hi> was as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MARY,</hi> I and you muſt part, I and you muſt part. I leave you behind me in the World, and my Prayer to God is, to keep my child, to teach my child; to keep you, and to make your heart to be full of love to ſpiritual things, that you may not be befooled of your Soul; that you may not be befool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Heaven; that you may not periſh like a Fool. And I charge you, I charge you, I charge you, <hi>in
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:109216:221"/> the name of God who is your Judge,</hi> that you hearken attentively to all the Counſel of your <hi>Dear Mother,</hi> and do not play it away, bable and trifle it away; ſee you do it for your everlaſting good and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and be obedient to her, and do not only be fondling, but hearken ſeriouſly to her Counſel, and take it in. <hi>MARY</hi> come to me, that I may give you one Kiſs. I am about to kiſs you; and this Kiſs muſt be a witneſs of my true deſire of your good. I Kiſs you in love; and my very Kiſs will be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt my Child, if you do not tread in the ſteps of your PARENTS, ſuch as you have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be good: O my dear Child, be not careleſs therein. I leave you now to the conduct of him who is my conducter.</p>
            <p>To a Chriſtian Friend who ſaid we muſt be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part with you, you have a <hi>Piſga-ſight</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> he replied, I think I am at the very end, and yet I do not go out; all the day long I am <hi>thirſting.</hi> O bleſſed be my God, I am perſwaded he <hi>will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all that concerneth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To another Chriſtian Friend at his taking leave of him he ſaid thus, I expect again to ſee you, and an innumerable company more of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further ſpake with reſpect to his languiſhing Body; If I could have ſomething or other to refreſh my Body, if the Lord ſaw it fit; but the whole Earth, I think, is inſufficient for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 25. This day being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the day of his Death, in the Morning he ſpake to a dear Friend a Miniſter, ſaying, <hi>The bleſſing of the everlaſting Goſpel be upon you, the Lord be with you.</hi> And about Eleven of the Clock he began to Change, having ſeveral Agonies; and between them, he deſired to be prayed for, ſaying, <hi>Lift up a
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:109216:222"/> Prayer for me, and ſpeak that I may hear you;</hi> For <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall ask on Earth ſhall be granted in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; let then the Earth be full of Prayer.</hi> And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of another fit, ſaid, <hi>Hitherto hath the Lord helped me, I am in the hand of God, I am in his hand and under his promiſe; the end of this affliction is in the hand of my God? the Lord enable me to abide his Will.</hi> And the <hi>5th</hi> Fit or Agony, which was 'twixt. four and five of the Clock in the Afternoon, he in that Breathed out his Soul into the Arms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of his dear Lord and Redeemer; retaining his ſenſes to the laſt; for even a little before his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, his Wife asking him how he did, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great compoſure, I am almoſt Dead, and deſired to be lifted up a little higher; which were the laſt words he ſpake; and a few moments prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Departure, he opened wide his Eyes, and immediately cloſed them again, and ſo <hi>Expired.</hi>
